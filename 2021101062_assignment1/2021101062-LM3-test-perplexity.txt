welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friends ransom that this had happened  but said franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscounti do not see him  nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly	3.0340819358825684
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting  of courseof course said the prisonersanyone can see hes a gentleman  well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade  50151m    i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus  the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper	7.37979793548584
my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger  laporte burst into tears	1.3134801387786865
and your two other friends he asked	1.1175590753555298
had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of france became desirous that he too should have his guard	1.4279853105545044
except that which i ask of you dear love  but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness  i cannot wait till tomorrow  silence	1.540690302848816
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength	1.3041574954986572
on what was dartagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling	1.5108416080474854
he gave us some very fine horses  and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own	1.5566819906234741
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor	1.1132240295410156
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of franz	1.2594050168991089
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on dutya zealous catholic no doubtshook off the charm for through the door he called hold your tongue madame	1.6604721546173096
ah said dartagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold	1.2186142206192017
drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all ones wit and cool judgment  idrunk said caderousse well thats a good one	1.738123893737793
at the end of a quarter of an hour m davrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house villefort himself was obliged to open to them	1.7351418733596802
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	1.2148370742797852
as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning  the owner did not wait for a second invitation	1.5065834522247314
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue	1.3824318647384644
alas said milady i know it is so	1.0906569957733154
no certainly not  you were sent by some other person  yes  by the excellent abbé busoni  exactly so said the delighted major	1.480943202972412
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles	3.377753973007202
didnt you hear fellow  yes i heard  why then didnt you reply  because these horses are not to be sold was the reply	1.5376501083374023
they wont devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all  and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos	1.5940630435943604
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson  french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends	1.7108370065689087
on my honor they are not poisoned	1.1073732376098633
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the armchair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand	1.5063921213150024
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind	1.8061420917510986
is that all then  in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory	1.2719753980636597
on the evening of the ball teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beadsshe was in the costume of the women of frascati	1.6670550107955933
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping	1.285906434059143
bernouin said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his  valetdechambre  who was behind him what musketeers are now within the palace  the black musketeers my lord  what company  trévilles company  is there any officer belonging to this company in the antechamber  lieutenant dartagnan  a man on whom we can depend i hope  yes my lord  give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on  the valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded	5.300943851470947
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me	1.2147668600082397
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus  are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning	2.2811715602874756
she has a carriage then this niece of the doctor interrupted porthos one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue	1.4210155010223389
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed  yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described	2.283817768096924
come he said tis a warning from heaven	1.1668070554733276
they were rapidly leaving the château dif behind	1.1564600467681885
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor	1.308076024055481
as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a dog  and yet meyou see plainly that i love you  you say so  i am an honorable man  you say so  i am a gallant fellow  i believe it  i am brave  oh i am sure of that  then put me to the proof  mme	2.6954662799835205
they will have nothing to do then at this end said mordaunt	1.174003005027771
debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry	1.327572226524353
sir said the cardinal you have heard me	1.0581390857696533
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so goodnatured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year	2.2591934204101562
where your life was spared  for shame	1.1564358472824097
ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow  the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag	1.311374545097351
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv	1.3972960710525513
anybody may possess a fivefranc piece  but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me	1.3592720031738281
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion	2.6715288162231445
in madame de villeforts room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall	1.4735496044158936
this treasure exists dantès and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will	1.293936848640442
to a look of interrogation which they made milady replied by a sign that it was he	1.2968995571136475
there remains the valise added porthos	1.1198043823242188
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly	1.3317815065383911
come speak avow freely that you accuse him  no sire but i say that he deceives himself	1.3753377199172974
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information  to auteuil cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became lividi go to auteuil  well what is there surprising in that	2.6082310676574707
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in	1.4645863771438599
there he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination morrels petition m de villeforts marginal notes	1.4550957679748535
then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor	1.375821590423584
is this possible count  on foot yes in a carriage no  i will go on foot then  is it important that you should go that way  yes there is something i wish to see  well we will go by the corso	1.919076919555664
dantès closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight	1.4833520650863647
be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing	1.6067094802856445
in fact about four oclock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance	1.8802287578582764
to the smaller  i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen  well what has happened to them  they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate  eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and dartagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men  the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers  arrested were they inquired athos is it known why  no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone i found this broken swordblade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones  tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis	18.4699649810791
those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache	1.2121186256408691
knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by  friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said  it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel  on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal	5.786799907684326
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea  undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it  but said dartagnan it is the queens diamond  the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos	2.1522457599639893
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo	1.1658087968826294
bravo cried one of the guests that is what i call talking to some purpose  just the person we require at a time like the present said a second	1.6594047546386719
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise  what a strange man you are	1.3921260833740234
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles	2.2279562950134277
both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london	1.6880617141723633
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow	1.7957019805908203
they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican bandits  and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers  alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another	2.2352216243743896
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family  insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword	2.1822922229766846
he didnt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous thing  mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place	1.94410240650177
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing	1.3828275203704834
repeat it cried dartagnan it will make a little change  not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in verse  the devil said dartagnan	1.5363227128982544
his eyes remained open and menacing	1.1007986068725586
i didnt understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is  you think so	1.3020005226135254
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château dif and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects	2.202380895614624
this was the abbé scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand toying nervously with a small switch	1.3395980596542358
all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted dartagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint	4.573330402374268
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air	1.2398487329483032
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town	1.6318347454071045
i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions	1.434199333190918
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs	1.446669101715088
you are right said the latter m	1.0938243865966797
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post	1.338675856590271
as to myself i shall go around to see athos for though i dont think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said dartagnan	1.738883376121521
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	1.4257733821868896
the gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chainedup dog went up to the cabin	1.5251003503799438
in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a skyblue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness	4.158110618591309
should you like to be rich and your own master    parbleu  said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question  take the postchaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and pontdebeauvoisin	2.2552106380462646
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me  but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness  not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure	1.8883823156356812
the day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the noise	1.237579107284546
we are lost  no said felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard  then run to the door and open it yourself  felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul	2.0189998149871826
at nine oclock madame la première présidente arrived	1.1252970695495605
we have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides i dont prevent you from listening but i must be gone  you must be gone said porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make  you will not wait till he asks you will speak first and tell him that i am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe	3.4225735664367676
come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us  hold your tongue will you said danglars pretending to restrain caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor	2.1961467266082764
i have a son too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage  then i have your leave sir  yes if you have nothing more to say to me  nothing  captain leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me  he was unable to write sir	2.4088094234466553
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence  i thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly	1.6598953008651733
aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal	1.8140101432800293
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained  it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo	1.6639201641082764
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed  excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you  ah	2.6138739585876465
he sends me for that purpose and here i am  the poor womans head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees	1.6113176345825195
who art thou cried he clasping his hands	1.1549104452133179
he was of middle height but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers	2.0906577110290527
good thought gondy she is going to yield  she is going to have him killed said dartagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me	1.5334491729736328
it is gods pleasure that things should be so  the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce	5.603186130523682
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead	1.700104832649231
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre  stay he said m	1.441074252128601
perhaps when all is considered you are right	1.1393569707870483
i knew a lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind  without revealing himself  he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude  oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then  30047m    he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julies voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist  and do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired emmanuel	4.878814697265625
every door was opened to him	1.0965230464935303
i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me	1.292484998703003
in the capture of a king his degradation and his murder  oh	1.2401732206344604
but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe	1.4144421815872192
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction	1.4044023752212524
oh maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness  heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself	1.8840456008911133
bowing under the weight of twentyfour years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of châteaurenaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	3.614708662033081
we will do the same  the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with dartagnan	1.3895803689956665
when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle  dartagnan said athos reproachfully	2.832150936126709
grimaud made a sign that he was going away	1.1176247596740723
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	1.5091404914855957
then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body	1.8303906917572021
i wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen  my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur dartagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery  mazarin thought for an instant	2.065084934234619
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance	1.3132215738296509
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets  thats because they dont see us said athos	1.4967762231826782
m de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	1.2089508771896362
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres  it appears so said athos since here they are	1.3575971126556396
take in two reefs in the topsails cried the captain let go the bowlins haul the brace lower the topgallant sails haul out the reeftackles on the yards  20041m    that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker  his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start	3.1861422061920166
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart	1.5214096307754517
drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive	1.3309345245361328
he wore a vest of garnetcolored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridgebox worked with gold and red and green silk skyblue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt	4.46378755569458
the steward wished to turn to the left	1.1218308210372925
mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance	1.2669353485107422
let us get down count and examine this rock  they both alighted	1.2807563543319702
but what did m danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur  oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himselfhalfmalicious halfferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame	3.107717990875244
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine  brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not inquired madame de villefort	1.8165818452835083
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder	1.1232759952545166
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon	1.2391172647476196
mercédès and albert were in that room	1.1347256898880005
at the sight of papers of all sortstitles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i foundnothing	2.696471691131592
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you  the old man nodded	1.262062907218933

the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him	1.6984297037124634
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not  tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head	2.350429058074951
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows	1.4058637619018555
in a moment  you didnt forget my purse  no be easy  good  porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post	1.5944792032241821
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain	1.162622332572937
eh monsieur eh  friend said dartagnan a halfpistole for that paper  my faith monsieur with great pleasure	1.3477548360824585

you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent	1.5336443185806274
as he entered the chamber of his friend dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view	1.7726960182189941
the rain of blood  as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glancebut there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened	1.8982511758804321
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father  i hope you do not doubt it  30137m    go then into the drawingroom my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you  andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	2.0297412872314453
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error  well then if it be so are you ready albert  perfectly  let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy  yes let us do so  the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said   i signori francesi   the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter	4.732068061828613
thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand	1.1850121021270752
dartagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly	1.1731994152069092
lift it and judge if i am mistaken  the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless	1.5795013904571533

undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office tomorrow  what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	2.9459221363067627
i think only that i have known you not a whole year	1.1752389669418335
trial   it was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till midnight	1.6167833805084229
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	1.3113751411437988

pardon me for quitting you my dear madame bonacieux said he but not knowing you would come to see me i had made an engagement with a friend	1.469681978225708
i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme	2.47973370552063
scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean  yes indeed my dear duke	1.301639437675476
i beg you to do so  i beg you to excuse me madame i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken  mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken	2.049943447113037
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano  the prisoner started and bit his lips	1.4010512828826904
m danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 francs	1.1899402141571045
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled	1.2356761693954468
three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres	1.5054165124893188
our friends  are become our most dangerous enemies athos	1.1721240282058716
by the female side i believe said the procurator maliciously	1.2131186723709106
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is  alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again	1.9505549669265747
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough	1.282796025276184
and why not  because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady  i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham	1.5586583614349365
lord de winter dartagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her	1.2293568849563599
those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder	1.3251088857650757
by my honor these gascons are incorrigible	1.1662087440490723
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if i fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen	2.060906410217285
some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close	1.350799322128296
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it	1.5192562341690063
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me	1.3025927543640137
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it	1.1767951250076294
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond	1.6006814241409302
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great ladyfor she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass	3.7373316287994385
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert  and the steamboat  she is at châlons  yes  the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels  very good  when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road  your excellency may depend upon me  the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers house	6.390954971313477
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds	1.5087854862213135
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed	3.7533934116363525
today is the twentieth of september	1.1153862476348877
gentlemen good morning  as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage  bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m danglars  for heavens sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere	2.755516767501831
morrels clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek	1.560394287109375
he vaulted hastily from his horse whilst planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house	1.3439195156097412
otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever	2.377185821533203
the mind can see as well as the body	1.1263775825500488
you surely will not do that my dear count  certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it  well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me  i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo	2.0946221351623535
go i will reflect  gondy looked at mazarin astonished and mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the palais royal	1.6237713098526
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors	1.5481048822402954
now then said dartagnan this is something like this is a means of communication	1.2208545207977295
in a moment they were at the canebière	1.0704455375671387
he is saved cried dantès in a paroxysm of delight	1.1511787176132202
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back	1.3523404598236084
will you let me be killed	1.1013681888580322
i have touched the hand of the great man cried bonacieux	1.130011796951294
one passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition	1.703235149383545
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	1.7138705253601074
30197m    calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time  ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile	3.25301194190979
one drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor	2.0746095180511475
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and i wish to know your name  yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince	1.7182055711746216
it is some superior officer making his night rounds said athos	1.2606018781661987
i hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should i accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess	2.511202812194824
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity	1.3090059757232666
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor	1.1841753721237183
do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the bastille  oh a day and night soon pass away	1.5043903589248657
come gentlemen let us all propose some place	1.1575884819030762
reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you threaten to speak and i will condemn you to infamy  you cried i	1.7109462022781372
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him	1.6113157272338867
by me  what was his name  lord winter  your uncle exclaimed cromwell	1.2196614742279053
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful	1.128005862236023
the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities	1.2840806245803833
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard	1.6592556238174438
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of mercédès  nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet	2.0132672786712646
you never come to me without conferring pleasure	1.1587703227996826
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion	1.424485206604004
richest my dear fellow  and dartagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket	1.230759859085083
after the king and the cardinal m de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens	1.4478917121887207
why he is surrounded by sultanas like a turk	1.12779700756073
the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit down	1.674354910850525
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder	1.728423833847046
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out to arms	1.3916053771972656
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him	1.186333179473877
he approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and dartagnan could get no hold	1.4332212209701538
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly	1.4217497110366821
he arose and stood near mousqueton	1.0903514623641968
as nine oclock sounded dartagnan was at the place royale	1.1771717071533203
as for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support him	1.285719871520996
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation	1.3209280967712402
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body	1.6810362339019775
he had tried his strength to the utmost	1.0972331762313843
are you going to rejoin your cardinal	1.1030279397964478
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do so	1.445075273513794
i your son as you call mei will not let you  twas the first time dartagnan had ever refused a request from athos	1.5056151151657104
why was i a prisoner  i do not know said mercédès	1.1581933498382568
thats well said athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to porthos and aramis	1.2647722959518433
have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself  as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château dif uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailors eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan	3.5009891986846924
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest	1.1965477466583252
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st	1.6436210870742798
bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him	1.2217473983764648
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him	1.4324604272842407
from that day dartagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven	2.136478900909424
you have some in the house have you not  yes  send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic  villefort immediately despatched a messenger	1.5823115110397339
see the sneaks come without drum or trumpet	1.191989541053772
adieu then and be of good courage said athos	1.1642661094665527
i do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of september it is ten years today since i saved your fathers life who wished to die  morrel seized the counts hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him	2.16292405128479
drink this and then take nothing more tonight  valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear	1.576874017715454
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us  i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	2.2186648845672607
yes and to hang me  they shall not have the king  nor hang me  listen	1.291722297668457
the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore i will not speak more fully now	1.3793022632598877
this brother was my only friend we became orphansi at five he at eighteen	1.3047122955322266
i have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me	1.3157099485397339
dartagnan was the youngest of all these men	1.0984455347061157
yes honesti can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbés gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays  0327m    so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished  such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases  you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error  what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise	15.668733596801758
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	1.8443620204925537
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features	1.8984038829803467
you would not have me marry under such sad auspices  my child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future	2.0507051944732666
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden	1.2252174615859985
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness  milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else	1.6554592847824097
he has received visits from the coadjutor from madame de longueville and the prince de conti madame de chevreuse and madame de vendome have left their names at his door	1.5298398733139038
and to you also m morrel my thanks are due	1.221602439880371
let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you	1.2109825611114502
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	2.170470714569092
that last order is useless interrupted dartagnan there are loaded pistols in your holsters  bazin sighed	1.392409324645996
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized dartagnan by the arm and said  if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not  yes my lord he replied	2.347639560699463
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought	1.5204445123672485
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham  anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said	3.913295269012451
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required	1.7266769409179688
jealousy gnawed his heart and he suffered almost as much as poor kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber	1.5808626413345337
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent	3.03389835357666
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved mea heart like yours felton a man like you	1.4771873950958252
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters	1.9997618198394775
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emeraldgreen sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning	2.225613832473755
three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fishpond	1.9472187757492065
alas said athos we depart alone  yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation  we are not yet at our destination observed the prudent dartagnan beware of misadventure  ah my friend cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens	2.339789390563965
if monsieur aramis hesitates to come he said tell him i am from tours  from tours cried aramis	1.3315778970718384
you will restore them to her majesty and as a last memorialhe looked round for some valuable objectyou will add  he still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade	2.3906455039978027
grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set off	1.238343358039856
goodbye then  goodbye till we meet again  they had arrived in the champsélysées	1.2558916807174683
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelleenserval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place	1.809812068939209
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend dartagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal  what	2.863530397415161
106 and goodbye to my dream of resembling the retired baker	1.305765986442566
well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments  ah  diable  bells did you say  what do you mean  oh nothing	1.739193320274353
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads	1.4980632066726685
at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government  well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever	2.769627332687378
come on come on said dartagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my halfpistole	1.3902205228805542
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes	1.10652756690979
oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver  of whom  of myself cried morcerf  parbleu  do you think i cannot be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads	2.0970687866210938
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love pains	1.4358434677124023
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon  and dartagnan dressed himself in an instant	1.2332204580307007

a fête was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her countenance	1.8664604425430298
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoi give you back your promise  it is well said dantès	1.4817274808883667

i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking  the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton he will not escape the chastisement he deserves  felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the puritans styled simply satan	4.3533477783203125
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me  but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	3.2584850788116455
as quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was doing	1.5848329067230225
when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them	1.956108570098877
a boattwothree murmured my fatherfour he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols	1.290897250175476
i go tomorrow my friend replied dartagnan	1.0961304903030396
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame bonacieux  who is that  her lover  what is his name  oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her anger	1.9388664960861206
he is the cause of all this miseryi am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars	1.4566081762313843
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly	1.5204368829727173
next day m morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bosom	2.117875814437866
my good dame asked dartagnan can you tell me what has become of one of my friends whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago  a handsome young man three or fourandtwenty years old mild amiable and well made  that is hewounded in the shoulder  just so	2.274557590484619
nothing but one word said dartagnan	1.0811327695846558
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance	1.551989197731018
every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes	1.4948821067810059
come come signor pastrini no joking we must have a carriage  sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all i can say  and when shall we know inquired franz	1.790509581565857
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there	1.6077823638916016
now sir said dartagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier	1.4118435382843018
during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m noirtier	1.3519803285598755
help help  barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps then fell at the feet of noirtier and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid exclaimed  my master my good master  at this moment m de villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold	2.304171085357666
to meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easychair	1.333224892616272
that time you had nothing to say to me i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second	1.3688486814498901
the door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity	2.0708959102630615
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her	1.995736837387085
on the honor of a gentleman but i cannot be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is impossible  what reason asked dartagnan	1.3475931882858276
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	1.4888637065887451
in the lucern patch  our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m de villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance	2.5212228298187256
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again  friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth	1.9843300580978394
what are you thinking of this evening  bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage	1.5863513946533203
it appears that after having challenged m de monte cristo at the opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today  impossible said madame de villefort	1.4903197288513184
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither	1.3592381477355957
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity	1.1554712057113647
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme	1.136392593383789
that was the question the three musketeers put to one another	1.186428427696228
yes my pocket has a hole in it  oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling	1.3466925621032715
thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse	1.1259926557540894
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances  and now i am convinced said dartagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris  the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration	2.208810806274414
if there is any left murmured he	1.1306018829345703
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated	1.2074474096298218
one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse	1.229767084121704
his eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to come	1.4401848316192627
i had such a delightful dream	1.0934091806411743
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave	1.6137499809265137
when you leave this you will behold my men at work	1.210236668586731
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	1.3511079549789429
monsieur said albert with affectionate courtesy the count of châteaurenaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also  well said interrupted châteaurenaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me  what has he done asked albert	2.704928159713745
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives	1.1177406311035156
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind	1.7168774604797363
port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by dartagnan and himself	1.3210710287094116
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation	1.2790777683258057
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade	2.9492857456207275
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity	1.5242079496383667
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the  pharaon    how dreadful said mercédès passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter  i bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said monte cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you  and the result of that letter  you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted	5.21911096572876
he fell down this morning and broke his leg	1.1386164426803589
a loud cry could be heard by her	1.114920973777771
boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee	1.3213918209075928
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak	1.681469202041626
the officer took bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two guards	1.2768657207489014
if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the abbé busoniin all probability we shall never see him  well then so i will said caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45000 francs	2.2408273220062256
the burglary  the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil accompanied by ali and several attendants and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining	2.0653905868530273
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done dartagnan but perhaps you have been wrong  dartagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him	1.9943723678588867
exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello	1.188157558441162
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city	1.2665143013000488
there was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said  welcome sir	1.4251071214675903
you know about it  was i not your second cried dartagnan	1.1552684307098389
the interests of the french crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation	1.3549442291259766
dartagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake	1.4077354669570923
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i dont stand upon ceremony said dartagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep	1.5069893598556519
and i for planchet said dartagnan	1.082798719406128
the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess	1.7652047872543335
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthoss long cloak and dartagnan rushed straight into the middle of it	1.3898128271102905
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian	1.5034812688827515
it was a strange thing and one which made dartagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful disorder	1.9028277397155762
a burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan	1.230258822441101
yes said the queen but his son  his son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother is  and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville  no madame for i presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of normandy  as to the government of normandy replied the queen i think i can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers  we shall search for some madame and i think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together  what next  what next madame  yes  that is all  havent you then a fourth companion  yes madame the comte de la fere  what does he ask  nothing  there is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asksnothing  there is the comte de la fere madame	14.03821849822998
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so longit will happen one day or the other  20083m    and do you propose to make this journey very shortly  i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements  i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo  i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability  incognito   the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice	12.26662826538086
wait here for me and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out	1.4789013862609863
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go  the count rang and a footman appeared	2.2077388763427734
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man	2.38859224319458
it seems to me said dartagnan with a thousand livres eachi do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator  this word  procurator  roused porthos	1.4744436740875244
besides by the faith of bonacieux  you call yourself bonacieux interrupted dartagnan	1.2125810384750366
and you my lord  if i wish to leave  that would be much more difficult  why so  your eminence might be recognized  even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	2.5045268535614014
oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain	1.5620317459106445
the countess de winter   as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from dartagnan not all that had happened but what dartagnan himself knew	1.4622164964675903
perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember  what do you mean my lord  i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience i have but you in the world haydée through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice  do you hear him valentine exclaimed haydée he says that through me he will sufferthrough  me  who would yield my life for his  the count withdrew for a moment	4.448422908782959
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence	1.226322054862976
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust	1.9532824754714966
i am sure i am the first cried morrel i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came	1.420749306678772
dartagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you aramis does the same to porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part i shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you	2.132307529449463
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine oclock in the morning to take a third letter	1.5023828744888306
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god	1.1724228858947754
if anyone comes call me  i will lieutenant said the soldier	1.1974753141403198
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do	1.2330036163330078
what is the matter dear grandfather said i are you pleased he gave me a sign in the affirmative	1.3187458515167236
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly	1.0781700611114502
i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france  30333m    valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	6.336911201477051
listen my dear girl said dartagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or other	1.3664110898971558
they passed into the eating rooma large dark room situated opposite the kitchen	1.2536089420318604
i mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not by her infamy soil an unblemished name that she shall not with one blow dishonor her husband and her child  no nooh no  well madame it will be a laudable action on your part and i will thank you for it  you will thank mefor what  for what you have just said  what did i say	3.200058698654175
dartagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him	2.0202653408050537
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength	1.6723031997680664
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these banknotes it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot	2.028079032897949
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall	1.241415023803711
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him  but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned  no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it  the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true	8.30582046508789
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me  felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger	1.9435772895812988
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger	1.3471041917800903
what can i do for you valentine  valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtiers eyes	1.4179295301437378
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here  he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality  by the way m de châteaurenaud asked beauchamp how is morrel   ma foi  i have called three times without once seeing him	3.5284223556518555
on our honor as gentlemen  then i may tell you all	1.1738908290863037
vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him	1.4331039190292358
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knowsdartagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant	2.188756227493286
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede  it is not for me to say  you are wrong you must advise me what to do  do you seriously ask my advice valentine  certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it you know my devotion to you  valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain	4.9145426750183105
yes with frenchmen and frenchmen like you  and monsieur du vallon added the other	1.2522672414779663
no i would rather die  by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated illfortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed  folly folly follyto carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at	3.0343964099884033
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison	1.6312323808670044
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos	1.3142906427383423
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching miladys bed offered her services	1.5543133020401

you heard m de villefort talking to m davrigny about the death of m de saintméran and that no less surprising of the countess	1.3484975099563599
you raised the whole district so they told me  very nearly replied planchet with a selfsatisfied air	1.3623132705688477
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousses letter	1.2403106689453125
morrel held out his hand to her	1.1106727123260498
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared	1.3059163093566895
no it will all go well m dépinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible  i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m dépinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation	4.422891139984131
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle	1.3304803371429443

you wore a close ruff a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe and in that cap a herons feather	1.5143101215362549
what is there astonishing in that  and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me  no  so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel  for you alone  the deuce	1.8990719318389893
quick kitty quick said dartagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel for if we leave her time to turn round she will have me killed by the servants  but you cant go out so said kitty you are naked  thats true said dartagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in thats true	3.154489755630493
its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health  my health is well enough said fernand clenching his hands without raising his head	1.7079131603240967
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	3.284169912338257
so far well said athos i perceive you know me  the comte de la fère murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther	1.7219510078430176
what a proposition  i thought perhaps said danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up  indeed said the receiver	1.4543533325195312
then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right	1.3057271242141724
i see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn  truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house it is the former executioner of bethune  the former executioner of bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired	2.6755762100219727
