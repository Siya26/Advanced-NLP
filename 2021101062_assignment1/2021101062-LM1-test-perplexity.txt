what is his name  you know him  indeed  yes  it is surely not one of my friends replied dartagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant	198.34559631347656
long life to the great cardinal the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m bonacieux and then when bonacieuxs cries were no longer audible good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city	251.86061096191406
it was just in time for valentines head swam and she staggered madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying  what a singular event	335.06463623046875
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived	330.7366638183594
where are you going cried the two musketeers in a breath	57.70881271362305
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion	383.2341003417969
oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person	255.87149047851562
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine  noirtier nodded his head	82.36283111572266
on the other bank replied the executioner	82.567626953125
the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic firtrees and myrtles	305.64959716796875
speak my friend i listen  there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear  oh yes yes exclaimed dantès and i tell you that i will save you yet  well then try	263.1481628417969
that was a superb throw so i left off there  dartagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast	244.57342529296875
well said franz anything newdo they refuse  on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him  well observed franz this chief is very polite and i see no objectionthe more so as i bring my share of the supper  oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house  his house	215.16232299804688
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme  20143m    and you will probably find your theme illchosen  but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	460.9538269042969
besides here is a piquant  fricandeau  and a fillet of beef  i am recruiting myself said porthos i am recruiting myself	92.02857208251953
ah sblood how you have hurt me	83.90454864501953
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her	36.65263366699219
oh why did i not tell you all	75.36096954345703
the races like the  moccoli  are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	147.37741088867188
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort  was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits  no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debtif indeed there existed oneand i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject	344.169921875
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing dartagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger	250.25860595703125
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill  very probably answered the count	326.60675048828125
dartagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeers uniform in every street of the camp	452.4388427734375
come hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it not so  30239m    nothing answered the baroness	257.2031555175781
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest	61.49812316894531
and what will that signify to me	81.38689422607422
go into the cavern with haydéei will not quit you said vasiliki if you die my lord i will die with yougo to selim cried my father	141.11302185058594
besides i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love	443.19757080078125
you were going to drink my wine  to the health of the king monsieur i was going to drink a small glass of it if fourreau had not told me i was called  alas said fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror i wanted to get him out of the way that i might drink myself  gentlemen said dartagnan addressing the guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day i beg of you  the two guardsmen courteously accepted dartagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired	208.24774169921875
stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time  hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms	133.62217712402344
yes i have replied franz i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered  cæsars  commentaries  said the bandit it is my favorite work  well are you coming asked albert	294.1551513671875
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal  this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal	103.15776824951172
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act	281.6650085449219
m de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence	69.48873901367188
escape had never once occurred to him	82.9037094116211
ah said porthos let us hear what he says  dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows  dear dartagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me	156.37188720703125
my dear planchet i am the happiest of men  and i may profit by monsieurs happiness and go to bed  yes go  may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur	252.27444458007812
now then to breakfast said beauchamp for if i remember you told me you only expected two persons albert  morrel muttered albertmorrelwho is he  but before he had finished m de châteaurenaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all overthat is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemarttook alberts hand	225.32965087890625
night came dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken	116.38483428955078
thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand	317.94091796875
i like to hear him talk said athos his dialect amuses me  gentlemen cried aramis listen to this  listen to aramis said his three friends	621.5866088867188
here is what you are looking for he said	77.49467468261719
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done	327.23077392578125
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses  i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost mewell somewhere about 30000 francs  debray conveyed the counts reply to the baroness	175.87014770507812
you have hastened to mecan i have the happiness of being useful to you  40286m    yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me  tell me what it is replied monte cristo	114.4408950805664
do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall	92.08097839355469
see the fatal example on the vendomois road dartagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so strongyou were beaten today aramis and i are beaten in our turn	248.79132080078125
as we have said he was lying on the deck	47.97220993041992
yes was the reply in a low voice	19.003189086914062
milady continued  one day our doors will ope     with god come our desire and if betrays that hope     to death we can aspire   this verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer	453.3521423339844
whither are you taking me asked he	61.837135314941406
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it	167.9025115966797
certainly i might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart	678.74853515625
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry	260.3326416015625
there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat	251.9140625
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all  the fact is said dartagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton  that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy i should be a ruined man  no for porthos will pay you  hum said the host in a doubtful tone	148.98594665527344
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables	96.94805908203125
as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentines room to m de villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward	146.00767517089844
grimaud meantime undid the means of escape	100.97229766845703
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out	41.32318115234375
some nabob from india was his comment	767.5339965820312
this letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead	316.7261657714844
mademoiselle de villefort is the culpritshe is the poisoner	86.52930450439453
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness	292.83807373046875
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up	266.1241455078125
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking dartagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him	116.33268737792969
i had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but i have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be	200.7491912841797
but i think i have it said athos	15.697294235229492
we have served them to the best of our poor means and god will recompense the will forgive the want of power	181.29104614257812
yez whats the dream said the swiss	26.805463790893555

davrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters room	547.9849243164062
well while i was watchingnot the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me illwhile i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was	129.20565795898438
then turning to noirtierdo you hope the assassin will be tried  no  then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine  yes  it is no news to you added davrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject	121.02540588378906
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable	1598.7935791015625
but in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry	272.6942443847656
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this  so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace	239.48558044433594
one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him  bear with him whispered aramis it is doubtless some spy  after my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man i shall hear you with pleasure sir  the man retired but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king	236.3941192626953
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	47.776527404785156
coquenard gently advised him to be patient	88.7733383178711
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation	243.0384979248047
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully	114.40853881835938
are you fond of traveling  my life has been passed on the high road  would anything retain you particularly in paris  nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris  very well	303.88433837890625
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival	144.51129150390625
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly  it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention	466.37652587890625
he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry	453.1023254394531
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris	132.69375610351562
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers  all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest	133.01258850097656
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger  that is well understood  and in that case how shall i know where you are  you do not want your lackey  is he a sure man  to the proof  give him to me	116.55010986328125
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants  we have forgotten to mention that the counts coachman was attired in a bearskin exactly resembling odrys in  the bear and the pasha  and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed	339.715576171875
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason  madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de larbresec and two at the door of your palacefifteen in all	94.74679565429688
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done	133.463623046875
now i belong to this lastnamed class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain	403.60833740234375
tell me now can you deny all this  and who told you this fine story sire asked tréville quietly	249.04757690429688

we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel  son of marseilles	152.97454833984375
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	145.6649932861328
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony  20207m    ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you  it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with them  what conditions have i forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it	158.9176483154297
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him  in that case go and get ready	148.5264434814453
dartagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes	247.8931121826172
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity	161.5134735107422
blacas remain  ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by lucks dooryour fortune is made  will it be long first muttered villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackneycoach	228.9922637939453
madame de saintmérans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must i let things take their course noirtier did not move	411.7806091308594
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might	1244.2318115234375
this personage was m bonacieux the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant and chivalric period	793.9580078125
the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile	174.561767578125
he had passed the night standing and without sleep	215.58966064453125
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies	362.7749328613281
his voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blueveined lids and he tottered like a drunken man	1229.3333740234375
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused	223.77696228027344
but what did you do yesterday after you left me  i went to tortonis where as i expected i found beauchamp and châteaurenaud	147.3986358642578
the diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands	317.8174133300781
this man was our old acquaintance gaspard caderousse	626.2216796875
fire then when the shot was fired	182.5324249267578
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light	352.8788146972656
milady is fair you say  she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable  ah my poor dartagnan said athos	177.80482482910156
debray continued  when you receive this you will no longer have a husband	161.00350952148438
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy tis his custom	894.655517578125
really i never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion  debray smiled	181.65892028808594
haydée  it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel	170.05099487304688
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of  yes it was i so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth  condescend to listen to me and you shall know all  i listen  i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers	227.76864624023438
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano  the prisoner started and bit his lips	691.4182739257812
then i saw that they took me for the assassin	99.38265228271484
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time	148.91128540039062
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine  bazin bowed low sighed and left the room	650.2242431640625
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme	362.3334045410156
dartagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m de tréville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinals arms	89.10255432128906
he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saintmartin and to be going towards the madeleine	177.75718688964844
the devil cried the host at his wits end	769.138671875
all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house	210.48529052734375
it cannot be surely valentine you are mistaken  no indeed i am not for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited	216.11334228515625
but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the artfor generally husbands  will  not seeyou would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world	212.0850830078125
we four will go and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number  you terrify me athos cried dartagnan	169.89369201660156
his heart beat but not like dartagnans with a young and impatient love	164.46383666992188
and you go into that house cried he briskly	839.1539916992188
well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples	143.6533203125
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger	118.41300201416016
he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth	938.443359375
he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities	234.99803161621094
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the wavesthat immense breaking of the oceanwith her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans  thou leavest thy servants lord     to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford     thy hand to lead them on   these verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry	284.0209045410156
this was not enoughhe must now learn to write	386.6694030761719
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament with these four elements paris is ours in a week and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from goodwill  it was now the coadjutors turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres	224.00201416015625
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise	132.28890991210938

some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel  come when he will it shall be kept for him	108.79377746582031
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for dartagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin	191.40565490722656
i have been heavens substitute to recompense the goodnow the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked  at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea	253.5623321533203

planchet turned and returned the billet	125.77476501464844
is he at liberty asked the queen	18.564937591552734
now is that all  i believe so  let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth dartagnan and athos to the bastille aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse porthos an ass madame bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion armentières on the banks of the lys	207.02479553222656
i could not have killed her by the same blowi should have fled from my country  dear albert said beauchamp	112.94926452636719
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	152.3935546875

then when de winter rose to take leave  listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband	104.23072052001953
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	217.07156372070312
these proceedings made dartagnan and porthos draw back	269.59039306640625
many small donations 1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs	587.0643920898438
we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pontneuf  lucien half smiled	236.75350952148438
i will say  do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself said bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that andrea was moved to the very soul	132.07078552246094
what was all that to scarron	1246.4974365234375

and the other one demanded the count	111.01712036132812

what am i to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant	209.78729248046875
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you  yes fair lady replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is i myself  but this castle then  is mine  this chamber  is yours  i am then your prisoner  nearly so  but this is a frightful abuse of power  no highsounding words	313.2610778808594

unfortunately i had not above 1500	24709.0390625
hearing the name of morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him	64.32716369628906
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues	194.76687622070312
melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world  i have been in illluck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news  ah indeed said monte cristo	74.94798278808594
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings service  dartagnan colored	440.1326599121094

i saw my fathers hand tremble	244.4127655029297
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	201.78318786621094
some wine said athos on perceiving the host	208.50668334960938
the two lower rooms consisted of a diningroom with a table chairs and sideboard of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece	1505.69580078125
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordhis majestys order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced	230.94888305664062
if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains out	901.8709716796875
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are  no it is not worth while  well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece  all right  he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs	243.3937225341797
this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men	261.5577697753906
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream	340.87774658203125
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	383.4097595214844
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard	236.6772003173828

but poor captain leclere  what happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation	132.6178436279297

then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him	136.97694396972656
i am the bearer of a letter that is all	59.919857025146484
but by degrees watchchains necklaces particolored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded	780.7072143554688
there are the acts signed i deliver them to you without compulsion	515.1554565429688
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing	156.9102020263672

in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the kings window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it  ah cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard  probably said dartagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his friends	269.68157958984375
thanks to m morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust  ah said villefort this seems to me the truth	127.68295288085938

the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke thus	176.8242950439453

observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites	430.6524963378906
