the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the fountain	347.6095886230469
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us  and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion  mousqueton smiled disdainfully	398.1460266113281

twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life	171.40138244628906
one drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor	316.0597839355469
for i had forgotten him said the lieutenant	45.55223083496094
or rather at what he said  and what was he saying  he said this madame mazarin is a stumblingblock	89.19998931884766
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died	86.34205627441406
i have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates   mithridates rex ponticus  said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast  edward you naughty boy exclaimed madame de villefort snatching the mutilated book from the urchins grasp you are positively past bearing you really disturb the conversation go leave us and join your sister valentine in dear grandpapa noirtiers room  the album said edward sulkily	669.0274047851562

as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation  they are hot royalists said groslow	243.66940307617188
come in exclaimed dartagnan and another servant entered	380.2914733886719
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession  then said the count i refer you to your confessor	243.30078125
this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly  ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart	359.365966796875
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of dartagnan cruelly mystified him	156.34347534179688
0099m    go on sir said he	19.376787185668945
blaisois seeing bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and christian charity	273.82550048828125
non capisco  do not understand was the reply	171.4042510986328
i hoped to be able to rely upon that  and i madame said dartagnan embarrassed you promised me  take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way  dartagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme	265.7813720703125

neveri could not  to me to a brother said felton	64.16629028320312
he fell back cursing with rage	34.79611587524414
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by dartagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over	147.38177490234375
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open	199.08934020996094

four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered	102.54717254638672
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him	145.40219116210938
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three illlooking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frockcoat and hat with broad brim	144.0880584716797
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it  ah	249.8304443359375
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n it is with n that we have to do then	453.5590515136719
if you do i swear to you for i have got to the end of my strength that i will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself with  how old are you	105.61461639404297
i have 1060000 francs remaining he said	333.7488098144531
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	350.9271240234375
the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilios wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen	780.1419067382812
his drawingroom under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the wellregulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained	520.4078979492188
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened with the sun gaiety revived	564.1517944335938
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet dartagnan	117.82684326171875
the devil take this gout  athos and aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned	270.057861328125
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it  the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand	138.9146728515625
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarrons pension  that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	552.8397827148438
morbleu  i wont be their dupe i will answer for it	200.62152099609375
but what were you to do with that woman asked dartagnan with anguish	111.79120635986328
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece  peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french  speak italian sir	499.367919921875
amid all this dartagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos	196.6907958984375
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality	220.17434692382812
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him	180.96310424804688
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog  i like the means well enough said dartagnan but where and how to meet with her  time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man	194.9110870361328
i told you of it yesterday	113.41956329345703
be it so replied dartagnan that is exactly what i want  dartagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause	205.71347045898438
you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you	259.7033996582031
and i asked mazarin after a moments silence	123.93544006347656
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmers son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback	310.31280517578125

this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation  the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more	268.7142028808594
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	197.07937622070312
oh yes with all my soul  well then listen valentine said the count i have a favor to ask of you  of me	72.39159393310547

now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monkof a man who resembles an echorepeating simply what he hears	185.26239013671875
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves	124.73237609863281
my son said the old gascon gentleman in that pure béarn  patois  of which henry iv	1670.6046142578125

the box taken by albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobilitys boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants	511.8113098144531
what do you mean by that  nothing my lord monsieur dartagnan belongs to the service monsieur dartagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs  you are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you  you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city  tis that exactly	220.6431884765625

porthos i doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers  it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos perfectly	573.1654052734375
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerfs brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives  but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you respond to her call	272.3930358886719
in june the profit amounted to 900000	481.1584167480469

the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait  yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners  bah said athos	261.6546936035156
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the rospoli palace	87.50938415527344
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos	151.97557067871094
at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness	89.16770935058594
so he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs	135.48251342773438
three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres	141.75816345214844
monsieur said athos placing his hand on dartagnans shoulder monsieur is the chevalier dartagnan of whom you have often heard me speak raoul  monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman  that little compliment could not fail to move dartagnan	198.71621704101562
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos	65.83348083496094
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champsélysées	160.40357971191406
and all thisall this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	230.22715759277344
my servants are examining the bodies  let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested raoul	278.1007995605469
why does he go in secret	178.2792205810547

those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night	438.7817077636719
as he departed danglars approached and said  well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at portoferrajo  yes most satisfactory my dear danglars  well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty  dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much	240.422119140625
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of henry iv	203.77474975585938
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand	104.36101531982422
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	373.7489929199219
the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule	196.8479461669922
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the  pharaon   yes  and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl  yes  now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things	181.0780792236328
and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage  not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my huntingknife	293.4872741699219
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know  and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts	127.13871765136719
faithful friend noble heart said the king i should not have been rescued	39.54651641845703
go and look for the comte de la fere i wish to speak with him  aramis found athos and brought him	43.494728088378906
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	124.21338653564453
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye	208.86410522460938
would you like a proof of it	66.4603271484375
the president again arose and having imposed silence saidsir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedif you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence  and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude saidi will not swear  then you must die replied the president calmly	303.42474365234375
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain	1554.2386474609375
this noise redoubled when dartagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church	73.15996551513672

milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more	157.845458984375
and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing	498.29632568359375
ah yes we burn as they say at the game of pincette	67.86841583251953
have you forgotten that m debray has just seen you at my house  ah true  fix it this way	261.3525390625
sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply  i have suffered deeply madame answered monte cristo	246.28662109375
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them	256.0418701171875
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	414.1514892578125
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband	302.9810485839844
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on	88.63726806640625
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him	95.12687683105469
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal	479.3515930175781
tell themoh tell them that corpse belongs to me  the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy	253.99278259277344
this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the  pharaon   the abbé shrugged his shoulders	194.15675354003906
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner	238.740478515625
well here we are at last said one of them	108.617431640625
the moment you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french law  i know it sir replied monte cristo but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves	216.13148498535156
thank you parry  when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	98.60811614990234
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview  say no more of that madame said felton	188.49192810058594
however amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent	794.8038330078125
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray	1008.067626953125
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman  however that may be dartagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but i am wrong to dispute with my master	144.5811767578125
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her	489.6464538574219
the case had been provided for if marie michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayerbook bound in green velvet  that is true monsieur you are well informed  one morning the green book was brought to her by the prince de marsillac	174.81674194335938
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you  true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you	118.43157958984375
the result of these reflections was that dartagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possiblea desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight	240.82586669921875
at halfpast three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour	112.00330352783203

gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so  this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it	135.63409423828125
the other drank it only by accident and although barrois is dead it was noirtier whose death was wished for  but why did it not kill my father  i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saintmérans deathbecause his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months i have given m noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison  oh have pityhave pity murmured villefort wringing his hands	207.5420379638672

30297m    at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	433.9303894042969

if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a birdofparadise	340.12469482421875
he soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning	685.68603515625
the ministers wife  pardieu   oh your pardon	318.4765625

without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king  to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority  and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal  he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	156.41998291015625
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed  dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety	305.2919921875

have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen  yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds  well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm  well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor i tell you you must not count on monsieur dartagnan  it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm  seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall	246.32737731933594

oh it would be a sacrilege	228.16563415527344
i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressingroom	105.69512176513672
look dartagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of bradshaws gaze she has not turned pale  it is lady fairfax herself said dartagnan	197.20240783691406
dartagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared	78.91663360595703

a propos  monseigneur continued tréville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not  thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger	115.29090118408203
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner	248.67271423339844
vicomte come here said athos the duchess permits you to kiss her hand  the youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the duchess de chevreuse	122.00941467285156
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted	180.67141723632812
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan	714.1251831054688
de villefortwhat do you mean  i mean that m de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a kings attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been  enceinte  six	313.5517272949219
the pistol i had heard had doubtless been fired at her	189.46847534179688
my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculousstupid	44.67555618286133
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them i learned it all  but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love  forgive me replied morrel i will go away  no said valentine you might meet someone stay  but if anyone should come here  the young girl shook her head	193.9083251953125
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos	88.51520538330078
you have lived three years in paris	28.34423828125
as she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage	850.3377685546875
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men  two menhow do you mean  yes the king and his lackey  oh	257.56890869140625
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze	285.8762512207031
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt	1986.728271484375
i will do as children do for fear of losing the paperrepeat the name along the route	329.09661865234375
i always said that dartagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which dartagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence	234.10897827148438
i tell you so by the faith of de tréville  how so  you will be assassinated  and i shall die in the performance of my duty  but your mission will not be accomplished  that is true replied dartagnan	72.15652465820312
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron	77.04795837402344
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarins niece	236.52084350585938
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and dartagnan remained master of the field of battle	159.9533233642578
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators  madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account  nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris	265.4880065917969
swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown	288.8342590332031
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italianof the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillowof the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the kingwho wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinalour cardinal didof the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morningof the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they sayso much the worse for herand who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me	249.27093505859375
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead	445.31146240234375
grimaud moved as if to leave the room	56.83780288696289
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	226.31675720214844
what do you say to that  i might answer sire that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness but so far from that sire i know the duke to be a royal gentleman and i refer the matter to himbut upon one condition sire  what  it is that your majesty will make him come here will interrogate him yourself  têteàtête  without witnesses and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke  what then	138.6112823486328
m de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post	136.037109375
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and dartagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written	126.15232849121094
you are not angry with me  not the least in the world  till then then  till then  bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick pace	106.9810562133789
he was called count he was said to possess 50000 livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme	380.7227783203125
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day i presume  that is the night my lord i answered	104.60569763183594
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry	309.3251953125
and the troop continued their route	62.54460906982422
if i may ask without indiscretion  near here replied de comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are  he is wandering about the environs of the castle thought dartagnan	343.3326721191406
then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body	146.77008056640625
has mankind treated me as a brother	74.816162109375
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise you  more intrigues	231.2550048828125
if it is gods justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose  morrel shuddered	702.121337890625
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the temple of friendship as the poets would say  why yes replied dartagnan with embarrassment	240.0260009765625
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul	155.77947998046875
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud to wait on us	564.5323486328125
what cried porthos are we all going away then	207.41746520996094
is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die  he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward  athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	179.35708618164062
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on	258.7688903808594
what then  ah my dear count said albert	16.066444396972656
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival	252.28768920898438
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man	560.55322265625
if i take you you will be hung  the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horses head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud	77.657958984375
the salon was filled with the works of modern artists there were landscapes by dupré with their long reeds and tall trees their lowing oxen and marvellous skies delacroixs arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arms their horses who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces  aquarelles  of boulanger representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic  pastels  by giraud and müller representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin sketches torn from the album of dauzats travels in the east that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosquein a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past	523.3378295898438
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you  mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm  and you should call it devotion added aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master  chevalier said dartagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston couldnt you especially after two or three days of fasting  oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois we havent known him so long  one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent	370.95489501953125
i had chosen this texttell me dear dartagnan if it is not to your taste non inutile est desiderium in oblatione  that is a little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the lord  stop there cried the jesuit for that thesis touches closely upon heresy	227.51129150390625
let us go and have a game at tennis la ramee  my lordi beg your highnesss pardonbut i must beg for half an hours leave of absence  why  because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast  well shall i send for some breakfast here  no my lord i must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castledaddy marteau as they called him  well  well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from paris an invalid ordered country air for his health  well what have i to do with that  why good lord	359.8265075683594
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud	161.09803771972656
i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle	991.0420532226562
is that your opinion dherblay  yes said aramis we have promised  then continued athos we have another reason it is thislisten in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry	161.5950469970703
let us come to some conclusion	673.29541015625
but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate  there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper	513.9071044921875
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	285.81451416015625
are we not eating a horse porthos	189.55397033691406
the anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	855.2026977539062
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	275.2789611816406
as for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support him	79.6814956665039
the next morning at nine oclock he entered franzs room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days	512.994873046875
let him be interred in holy ground	425.9840393066406
come said dartagnan all this leads to nothing	315.6152038574219
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too	121.59077453613281
the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons	280.35064697265625
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career	548.4718627929688
porthos looked at dartagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions gascon sharpness continually supplied him	386.4566955566406
fortunately dantès had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth	190.76910400390625
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely	239.3970947265625
did i know poor dear edmond	145.44129943847656
if so speak out answered athos	117.58302307128906
you would like one that sails as rapidly as  lightning interrupted mordaunt	1445.1998291015625
40036m    she pointed to each letter of the alphabet	157.64724731445312
when i entered the house the first thing i beheld in the middle of assuntas chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old	195.9632110595703
at length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	180.7278594970703
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthoss nor aramiss and as to athos he had none	124.97134399414062
no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of it  it is much more convenient at pariswhen anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly  that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel  but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel	272.94195556640625
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days	773.4498291015625
dartagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords	204.4994354248047
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are  i rely on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saintméran insist that m dépinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract  then you have my promise maximilian  instead of signing  i will go to you and we will fly but from this moment until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each other	237.62155151367188
villefort had never been so concise and eloquent	1077.027099609375
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income	105.6761245727539
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	67.77369689941406
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england	69.50802612304688
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between us  ingrate that you are  ah	217.01815795898438
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans	247.0774383544922
hold sir said villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene	196.2698516845703
you shall die  and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon dartagnan	183.83460998535156
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos	271.9161071777344
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction  what	294.04840087890625
yes i understand  my lord observes that there will be enough to go around  we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke	178.99099731445312
but he is mistaken i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point  anne blushed and buried her face in her hands	309.21563720703125
what would you have said the musketeer	29.083293914794922
end of the port wine mystery	1509.76220703125
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city	289.55255126953125
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain	392.7156982421875
but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyone who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation  and have your notions changed asked dantès with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me  no neither do i wish to incur guilt	306.6210632324219
in vainwere i an ambitious manshould i struggle against such remembrances as he has left but that i am not ambitious i am going to prove to you	149.53538513183594
come my friend said he courage then he turned to the officer	118.74298095703125
the next day m noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	98.76514434814453
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it the officer entered	198.148681640625
but be assured my dear monsieur dartagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself  oh i dont doubt that replied dartagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of armsa certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance  this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities	178.72727966308594
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix	257.82373046875
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning	181.43756103515625
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray	265.51129150390625
andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered	408.8167724609375
i descended rapidly although i had not seen villeforts face i recognized him by the beating of my heart	87.30049133300781
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning	73.93091583251953
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with gins snares and traps	1005.8584594726562
thats well said athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to porthos and aramis	94.16793823242188
the carriage stopped the footman sprang off the box and opened the door	70.35694122314453
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us	283.7588195800781
dartagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat	164.04824829101562
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant elkobbir	141.60379028320312
yes i  and why  you   because i alone know  what  that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears  indeed said milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for i really cannot tell what you mean  and she looked at dartagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away	188.2666473388672
if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea	161.7081298828125
tomorrow morning at seven oclock you will be with me will you not  we will  hush the curtain is rising	137.95448303222656
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	1497.8323974609375
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird	69.37422180175781
m dépinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations  however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m dépinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort  ah that would be a great pity said villefort	151.22549438476562
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master	73.90025329589844
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easychair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there	193.59762573242188
when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them	228.51548767089844
you tell me he burned the letter  he did saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you  this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural  you think so  i am sure of it	223.4656982421875

ah m andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do  charmingly as you see	138.67825317382812
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall	184.9408416748047
i do not  hem said dartagnan there is some truth in what you say  ah	106.56021881103516

teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended	123.68612670898438
of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly	374.62237548828125
noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old mans eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child	352.5975646972656
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus	222.11227416992188

an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall	407.09344482421875

dartagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friends house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni	213.69293212890625
a gendarme was crossing the court	20.34160041809082

no i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well  so much the worse said porthos	37.16477584838867
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled	101.12445831298828
a gesture a smile and a word from grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded	566.9263916015625
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected	266.9421081542969
this time my determination is irrevocably taken	325.7603454589844

they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep	567.1343383789062

i cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what time meant	155.0088653564453
then he stepped into his  coupé  calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes	92.65766143798828
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st germain	94.35234832763672
then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes	494.4902648925781
nothing and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news  yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king  to the king	105.25138854980469
the reference is no doubt to the  wistaria frutescens ed	167.88409423828125
besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present  how can you know that	150.96302795410156
no certainly not and from this moment i will endeavor to model myself after him	183.90835571289062
monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry toward etampes and monsieur de chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sortie	243.85235595703125
everything is ready is it not  yes  the cargo on board  yes  five full casks  and fifty empty ones  good  we are carrying port wine to anvers  excellent	906.330810546875
the jailer continued  now this was his project	266.774169921875
monsieur bertuccio  meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20000 francs apiece for his horses	145.11024475097656
yes sir  come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit  do you not guess monsieur asked morrel	108.39385986328125
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh	135.1529083251953
you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger  grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier  grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall lyons will hasten to welcome him	727.101806640625
you see felton the drama has gone through all the phases i named but be easy no blood will flow  milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave felton an immediate and terrible proof of her courage	482.88665771484375
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice	188.35833740234375
from this phrase dartagnan awakened planchet the reader must not suppose it was night or that day was hardly come	459.471923828125
it matters little now to me	16.566574096679688
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused	441.25189208984375
bah said porthos why separate since we are all together  because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but ours is not  your mission is not accomplished exclaimed dartagnan looking in astonishment at athos	232.75157165527344

i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody  they are firing at the corpses replied athos	379.23681640625
adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door	226.62818908691406
this event might have three causes  the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majestys guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a wellfurnished purse in his pocket	106.71428680419922
no part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information	501.893798828125

i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing	330.96478271484375
all i have is at his service  the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m caderousse  yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service  gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest	313.10858154296875
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade	64.19696044921875
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged	329.71441650390625
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	101.03900909423828
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous	149.40943908691406
it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you	267.8126525878906
to your eminence murmured bonacieux rolling his eyes round in astonishment	156.76719665527344
there still remained planchets horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a step	143.0770263671875
at six oclock lord de winter came in	41.22462844848633

so i think and therefore i said were our object money only but we want something else replied the gascon	231.7830352783203
goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent	269.30157470703125
yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life	1288.53857421875
pray dartagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you	664.9754638671875
i left five hundred with assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred i set off for nîmes	291.1600036621094

and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked debray	489.59698486328125
is monsieur your brother said dartagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing	151.71571350097656
tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul  bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered	515.6189575195312
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame  yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father  and he rushed out of the study	147.53672790527344
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification  the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance	147.7811279296875
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam	1021.3467407226562
how was he going to find athos	40.95376968383789
but this is not to the purposeour business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace  all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium	218.31314086914062
in 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos	102.85040283203125
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder	97.42561340332031
ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport  where  do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea	530.4418334960938
athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said trifles only trifles that was his favorite word	549.661865234375

ah those orientals they are the only men who know how to live	101.52320861816406
the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell	86.51787567138672
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco knownfrom the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakiawas exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouthpieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers	607.3277587890625

on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat	437.9942626953125
my lord i think we are in bad company  a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand	110.86365509033203
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her	323.1054992675781
what the devil continued the king	24.053836822509766
i will not miss you  if i give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword	139.47657775878906
yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay  madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife	288.54864501953125
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning	224.8941650390625
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil	155.62185668945312
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis	168.50936889648438
doctor do you hear them call for help  yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentines room  but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening	181.73524475097656
arriving at the faubourg st antoine he turned round to look gaily at the bastille but as it was the bastille alone he looked at he did not observe milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two illlooking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him	203.41505432128906
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard	371.0160827636719
the little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high	233.82025146484375
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud	78.07864379882812
now if you please remove your bandage the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes	197.08990478515625

when does m dépinay return  we expect him every moment  it is well	205.48680114746094
yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow	490.4790954589844
oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i dont know my way	112.87060546875
they proceeded to the rue saint denis	39.21089553833008

in short said dartagnan this has been the will of god  it was not i who killed him said athos in a soft low tone twas destiny     chapter lxiv	177.68870544433594
to maintain a cause which i believed sacred i have lost the throne and my children their inheritance	242.81007385253906
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again  and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but morehe is one of our friends  no madame replied raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle  the young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor	273.35455322265625

but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between luciens visit and the curiosity of the baroness	158.9259796142578
i have always said to you i love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is anothers is not this true fernand  yes that is very true mercédès replied the young man yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry  0045m    you mistake fernand it is not a law but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor	148.42674255371094
athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road	204.42955017089844
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened	143.3902587890625

in the eyes of many benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law	162.7373046875
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this	209.48291015625
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory	541.0160522460938

the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them	298.4052429199219
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coollysuch were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely	417.1923522949219

oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again	285.9753723144531

sir said the servant i have a favour to ask you  speak out my friend  i am afraid to do so	35.52900695800781
was that it  if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said dartagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavyfor with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like  these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery  at all events answered dartagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their swords  he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money	198.197265625
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground	158.38861083984375
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool  sweet child murmured monte cristo	133.02711486816406

adieu  i entreat you doctor  all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal	1135.318359375
dartagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called moustonwas it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was	297.4453430175781

albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo	29.701318740844727

the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared	115.12762451171875

except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career gérard de villefort was as happy as a man could be	218.44561767578125
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death	677.08935546875
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages	334.600830078125

ah since the dangers i incur on my own account cannot stop you think of those you may yourself run  me  yes there is peril of imprisonment risk of life in knowing me  then i will not leave you  monsieur said the young woman supplicating him and clasping her hands together monsieur in the name of heaven by the honor of a soldier by the courtesy of a gentleman depart	123.87860870361328

they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place	122.72347259521484
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	283.0870361328125
and who is the assassin they asked together	436.9747619628906

and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went	690.0155029296875
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him  and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week  and dartagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling	157.78013610839844

it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours   attorney   but how do you know all this  because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound  has he been wounded then  oh good lord	201.6898651123047

there said dartagnan what did i tell you	60.75020980834961
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty	377.8177795410156
i requested him to call and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came to desire him to wait  let him be sent for instantly  your majestys orders shall be executed but  but what  but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey  my orders  yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king  well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her myself  your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture  yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of that  whenever it shall please your majesty but i shall be always happy and proud sire to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of france  very well cardinal very well but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals	175.60357666015625

in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart  the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine oclock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it	107.44120788574219
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris	104.81529998779297

well if so why do you object to my doing so  i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection  did he reflect before he insulted my father  if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied  ah my dear count you are far too indulgent  and you are far too exacting	166.9505615234375

and you have come here with that purpose  grimaud repeated the sign	323.4970703125
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him	34.72763442993164
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womans regrets	239.13470458984375

you will be served thus madame three times a day said he	244.2501220703125
m de tréville listened to the young mans account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair	216.16879272460938

you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good hand  well what then  well the englishman and his companion are still here	155.9875946044922
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness	177.63600158691406
eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge	129.577880859375
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity	175.8612518310547
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor  and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice	114.03919982910156
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist  doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys  speak lower aramis said athos	351.8052062988281
oh father do not look in that way at me	113.94142150878906

if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france	163.82093811035156
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us  it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore  where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council  yes said aramis athos is right  animadvertuntur in desertis   a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it  there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	204.41287231445312

nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	289.59246826171875
