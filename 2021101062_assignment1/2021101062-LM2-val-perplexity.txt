toward eleven oclock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court	215.61843872070312

it was a superb moonlight night	454.92041015625
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger	73.11215209960938
dartagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her but she as her only reply drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him	59.39099884033203
oh my god my god have pity on me  without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m bonacieuxlamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomedthe two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting	124.89693450927734

are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends  particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars	91.21826171875
the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed halfhours interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes	441.1430969238281
the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely	172.26748657226562
i did go to monsieur dartagnans  what was the aim of that visit  to beg him to assist me in finding my wife	107.00360870361328

his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed	525.8927001953125
does he regret me a little	158.666259765625
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented benedetto from killing you but i found you proud and bloodthirsty and i left you in the hands of god  i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse you do not believe it you lieyou lie  silence said the abbé you will force the last drop of blood from your veins	164.2106475830078
if that is really so how came you in the bastille  how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i dont know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal  you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason  of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason	94.76775360107422
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses ones self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection	516.7822265625
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athoss closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords	178.04713439941406
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	90.20206451416016

at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat	451.33709716796875
yes yes and now i believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured i will return the favor hereafter  villefort shook his head	71.9115219116211
all this savors of his eminence a league off  but what is to be done said dartagnan	97.80963134765625
ja in the most german and the least gascon accent possible	501.3927001953125
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	175.47007751464844
but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy	197.3894500732422

la jeune amélie  left it threequarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica	89.68017578125
and a comforting one too added dartagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man	125.29546356201172
at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle	98.14161682128906
unlimited credit  about two oclock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his featuresa person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porters lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within	266.64404296875
i buy those horses he said to the groom	168.47503662109375
i think nothing my friend but all things are possible	85.30359649658203
the spaniards  that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation	429.5791931152344

no said albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself  then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristos question and alberts answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it  monte cristo reflected one instant	463.83160400390625
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day	95.48262023925781
dartagnan appointed eight oclock at athoss residence	221.48890686035156
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner	132.7201385498047
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees	163.5157012939453
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself	63.646976470947266

speak  you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness  who are you then	206.8350372314453
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves	410.2088623046875
the moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment	171.72036743164062
another had done all this why then was it impossible to dantès	222.43331909179688
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister	103.20938110351562
and you cannot deny it added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice	59.11777877807617
the three presents of dartagnan the elder  chapter ii	204.556396484375
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poniard  buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand the hand of the infanta for king charles i who was then only prince of wales	161.4177703857422
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled	262.6920471191406
he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met de rochefort	88.00810241699219
he has orders to do so	84.41062927246094
as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct  what a madcap i was and what a stupid fellow i am	304.6541748046875
we traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking	488.207763671875
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe	141.12310791015625
marie michon   and what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading	224.86456298828125
the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death	137.40615844726562
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with  but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked milady	300.3730163574219
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw	167.72669982910156
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us  but this fire continued franz	129.9464111328125
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies  that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them  well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing	197.09336853027344
i think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality	69.99385070800781
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them	384.214111328125
let us to bed  and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by dartagnan	36.408695220947266
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb	169.96109008789062
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	322.0946960449219
la carconte doublelocked the door behind the jeweller     chapter 45	67.59654235839844
the queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her	127.02842712402344
do you not see how she suffers  haydée answered with a heartrending expression  why should he understand this my sister	231.82093811035156
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwells cuirassiers	326.77734375
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe	188.0133056640625
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight  then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch  take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	116.28714752197266
you are somewhat  blasé  i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others	291.0680847167969
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door	115.84896850585938
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down	246.8595733642578
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert	69.96978759765625
the queen had just regained her chamber and dartagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly touched	115.55072784423828
i am not unhappy while i possess my son  ah just so said albert here begins the trial	170.18533325195312
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here	335.15313720703125
he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long	229.23948669433594
oh sir exclaimed m de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair	118.18904876708984
dartagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense	182.86659240722656
she will save us said conti	271.15814208984375
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	225.3728485107422
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges10 or desdemona	149.73458862304688
as porthos and aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his clothes	145.6507568359375
a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time he had not tasted food for forty hours	161.6063690185547
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people  that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shoppeople and the bands of mendicants reappeared	346.73004150390625
yes keep itkeep it  monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time  no said danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures	223.43287658691406
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion  it matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs	210.59974670410156
noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from despair	500.45513916015625
the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and dartagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss	165.3518524169922
i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy	64.16932678222656
who calls richelieu calls satan  hold your tongue hold your tongue madame	805.1642456054688
i will swear to you by my souls salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment  tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth	125.1427230834961
i may sleep perhaps at an inn  pierre obeyed	607.3335571289062
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman	307.9385986328125
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes  morrel  yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied	124.39814758300781
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach	158.74156188964844
no and you porthos  no and you athos  no  if it was not you it was your purveyor said dartagnan	118.13349151611328
oh said she seizing the counts hand and raising it to her lips oh thank you thank you edmond	59.83531951904297
soon the two gentlemen stopped also	234.31961059570312
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man	49.85557556152344
by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades	343.90087890625
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover	294.59112548828125
and who has seen this  fleurdelis  inquired aramis	77.65829467773438
i suppose you mean continued dartagnan	38.120521545410156
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected	101.43610382080078
well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count	78.87216186523438
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey	79.64336395263672
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered	71.9665756225586
we shall be alone and can make up our accounts  in good time	92.45093536376953
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string	231.83343505859375
albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smokingroom on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down	124.27156829833984
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed	50.753726959228516
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	102.57006072998047
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine  the count smiled	110.27041625976562
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow  then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today  i will not irritate him thought edmond and taking the paper of which half was wantinghaving been burnt no doubt by some accidenthe read  this treasure which may amount to two  of roman crowns in the most distant a  of the second opening wh  declare to belong to him alo  heir	221.5435333251953

athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	168.86512756347656

danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well	196.55859375

i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if i do i shall learn nothing further  at this very moment mazarin entered	167.42066955566406
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	145.0894775390625
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone	83.15245819091797
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved uselessfor though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months	208.0330810546875
on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property	248.7783966064453

albert related it to his mother châteaurenaud recounted it at the jockey club and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the counts courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy	249.0134735107422

meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work	356.9841003417969
jussac fell like a dead mass	173.77081298828125

parry said the king rising too my horse i desire to go to thirsk  egad said dartagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at his service  if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london  how so  because before then we shall have carried him off  well this time athos said dartagnan upon my word you are mad  have you some plan in your head then asked aramis	155.05410766601562
they employ him because they are afraid of him	145.55833435058594
gracious heaven we are hesitating cried dartagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do  i do not hesitate you know said grimaud	185.20391845703125
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway	392.3761291503906
i like everyone  and you include me in the expression everyonemany thanks  let us not mistake said monte cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few	345.5815734863281
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her	222.44508361816406

i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france  30333m    valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	120.97474670410156
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos	146.4969024658203

no but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for instance  my dear little love	137.62242126464844
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring  but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me  i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you  you know what i have done  i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening  a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady	120.35163116455078

did you see the president at the ministers last night  yes  what did he say  something which will surprise you  oh make haste and tell me then it is a long time since that has happened  well he told me that benedetto who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning is really but a very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death  bah said beauchamp he played the prince very well  yes for you who detest those unhappy princes beauchamp and are always delighted to find fault with them but not for me who discover a gentleman by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry  then you never believed in the principality  yesin the principality but not in the prince  not so bad said beauchamp still i assure you he passed very well with many people i saw him at the ministers houses  ah yes said châteaurenaud	254.18202209472656

30185m    madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority	193.56484985351562
lastly her hair which from being light in her youth had become chestnut and which she wore curled very plainly and with much powder admirably set off her face in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose	329.63250732421875
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you	195.73207092285156

only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance	208.43878173828125
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight  what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	183.787109375

my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box  why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask  at that instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head	130.28610229492188

you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french	110.57624053955078
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless  and how was m de saintméran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count	147.7367401123047
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying	219.1128692626953
with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative	79.91368865966797

but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of selfdependence that characterized her countenance	384.67498779296875

nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you  30165m    noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	161.8489227294922
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage  he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity	161.56985473632812

davrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead	126.71922302246094
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant	459.6176452636719
i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack  be of good cheer replied dantès your strength will return and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria and took his hands	230.308837890625

woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison and woe to those who forgot that i was there  50229m    as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman	169.35806274414062

dartagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queens apartment	242.5281982421875
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night	277.352294921875
