there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves  i do not accuse them sire but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes  yes you are right tréville you are right  then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty cannot be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal  yes tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty	16.13764762878418
what are you going to do cried mme	1.143252968788147
oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes	2.5744500160217285
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring	1.2251845598220825
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire	1.6294208765029907
my dear m dartagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands he paused	1.3718647956848145

one can say anything to me	1.1050664186477661
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian	1.3362317085266113
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i dont know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him  oh yes but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of  what the mercers wife of the rue des fossoyeurs	2.910686731338501
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out  doctor doctor	1.981824278831482
excellencies said he the coach is ready  well then said franz let us to the colosseum  by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies  by the streets  morbleu  by the streets cried franz	2.2203407287597656
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousses murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends	5.258398056030273
ah monsieur cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more trouble	1.321462631225586
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch  shall i write your deposition	1.4728909730911255
i could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks	1.4632515907287598
he jumped out of bed and ran to the window	1.1551973819732666
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	3.5069870948791504
hush we are flying i did not understand	1.2004202604293823
but dartagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait  athos stopped	1.3475384712219238
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair	1.2443804740905762
they were approaching the scene of war and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow	2.417703628540039
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressinggown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames	2.3512747287750244
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms	1.7509515285491943
it seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined  oh	1.4158412218093872
you had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness	1.3005585670471191
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever	1.2771450281143188
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks were	1.5108791589736938
dépinay cannot leave the drawingroom at present  it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m franz dépinay  grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness	2.6517672538757324
here i await the army of my rebellious subjects	1.2408695220947266
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him	2.2152276039123535
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms	1.342734932899475
may i not go and see my friends  yes sir you shall see them	1.2876816987991333
it was a name that too often resounded in her majestys ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth	4.07078742980957
she renewed the order relative to the gascon but as before she expected him in vain	1.3766120672225952

the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès	2.9147372245788574
bonacieux and was expressed in these terms  there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you	1.5966440439224243

dartagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold	1.7311182022094727
and have you any recollection of your country  when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again	1.559585690498352
believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you	2.3936374187469482
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated  i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris  pshaw	1.9231996536254883

they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion	1.5213861465454102
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson  french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300000 francs and have those 300000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again  unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision	11.716002464294434
what will you do with the letter then asked porthos	1.1458425521850586
patience madame i am coming to it  thats fortunate  in april you went to dine at the ministers	1.5309057235717773
m de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin	1.9115015268325806
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to nîmes	2.0803139209747314
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences  valentine seized the counts hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips	1.9759294986724854
fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat	1.7547425031661987
he wasnay probably may still bea bonapartist and is called noirtier i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort	1.8922090530395508
do not call anyonedo not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of  valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the counts marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girls mind	12.047650337219238
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	1.3434460163116455
having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian  it is halfpast eleven oclock haydée will soon be here	2.5042107105255127
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	1.3227945566177368
they were those we rode on and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them	1.541427493095398
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	1.4138203859329224

edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	1.754634976387024

let us put down 120 added albert smiling	1.2010096311569214
finally he promised that he would leave her mistresss presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid	1.8334683179855347
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	1.3168972730636597
bravo cried mazarin they told me that you were the man i wanted	1.269228458404541
we can go to brussels liège aixlachapelle then up the rhine to strasbourg	1.2560402154922485
dartagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m de tréville grasped the situation	1.643291711807251
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water	1.9942436218261719
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated	1.5847415924072266
this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow	1.9335050582885742

in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts pistol	1.8888094425201416
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you  be it so then replied athos sorrowfully	2.388583183288574
athos and dartagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer	1.7513816356658936
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him	2.362121105194092
poor man he is a worthy creature he left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant	1.8463255167007446
he took to his heels and was soon at m de trévilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de trévilles office	1.801892638206482
go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not having been foreseen i dont know what to do  the soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer	2.0273959636688232

in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental dartagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance	2.6388320922851562
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations	1.664304256439209
that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de winter	1.23130464553833
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those farfamed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale	3.2547340393066406

he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land	1.2920336723327637
oh father do not look in that way at me	1.2146553993225098
let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds  dartagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family	2.8084487915039062
at this very moment the court is making overtures to me hitherto i have repulsed them but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so ive a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now  accept it my lord accept it said aramis	3.63458251953125

there however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank	1.4032665491104126
at the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing	1.6449480056762695
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	1.9781174659729004
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart  and he gave him his hand	1.7346174716949463
everything was conducted in the usual manner	1.1520241498947144
i have a post by which i live at the death of monsieur de tréville who is old i may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless gascon	1.9483157396316528
this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimneyboard which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left	6.598132133483887
dantès told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm	1.4128503799438477
for what purpose  upon my honor i will instantly return it to you	1.3371127843856812
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps	1.7244477272033691

now i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it  there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm	3.1861414909362793
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector  the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor	1.9653377532958984

she has near her a certain laporte  who i believe is the mainspring of all this i confess said the cardinal	1.4845823049545288
it would be a curious idea and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles	1.4387032985687256
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends	1.6214526891708374
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort	1.177507758140564

andrea read in a low voice  you are poor a miserable old age awaits you	1.4253605604171753
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour  ah baron baron said albert you are not listeningwhat barbarism in a megalomaniac like you  oh dont worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he said  but will you undertake to speak to the father  willingly if you wish it  but let it be done explicitly and positively	8.602789878845215
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts	2.1347157955169678

noirtier watched her with evident anguish	1.1866074800491333
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles	1.254226565361023
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge	1.6520015001296997
in the first horseman she recognized dartagnan	1.1729271411895752
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up	1.3402273654937744
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winters athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raouls account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle	2.765289306640625
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company  it was about four oclock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them	3.731605291366577
and he is dead  yes  well sir said darminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted	1.4903671741485596
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady	1.227380394935608
what an appetite you used to have	1.192181944847107
a paltry piece of business murmured dartagnan crumpling his note	1.2668629884719849
do you remember how he cried on dartagnan on i am taken	1.2361536026000977
that makes no difference said aramis coloring and who affirmed as i said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came  it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely	3.11601185798645

i will read you the first canto	1.1413538455963135
it is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked dartagnan	1.2918126583099365
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance	1.4988927841186523

oh attend to it valentine i entreat you  but no said valentineno i tell you it is all past and it was nothing	1.538836121559143
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the count had no hold on franz who had nothing to conceal	1.6672595739364624
dartagnan examined her with a rapid glance	1.1589839458465576
yes kill them cried dartagnan i see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place  in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening	2.494561195373535
thus for instance dont you in the first place want a horse  yes a horse  well then	1.4227572679519653

i thought there were four of you  listen to me sir	1.2124531269073486
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	1.3067221641540527

yes  what to do  noirtier made no answer	1.1622763872146606
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children	2.1267216205596924
now jump down athos  athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall	1.3640621900558472
for the rest this vengeance was very easy for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber itself	2.15285062789917
non capisco  do not understand was the reply	1.182870626449585
this cant last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	1.2684506177902222
40194m    business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	1.3083198070526123
that reply led to several questions about the kings capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely	2.2751786708831787
de boville receivergeneral of the charities   ma foi  said monte cristo i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me  danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out	2.2981090545654297

true monsieur said mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small huntinghouse  mousqueton thy pistols said dartagnan	1.458991527557373

why it was he who carried me off  that may be madame  and you receive silver from that man  have you not said that that abduction was entirely political  yes but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august mistress  madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done  monsieur said the young woman i know you to be cowardly avaricious and foolish but i never till now believed you infamous  madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what do you say  i say you are a miserable creature continued mme	23.172718048095703

for an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk	4.957206726074219
shall you never leave me again	1.13068425655365
what do you say  i say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death	1.4317201375961304

athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins	1.6600555181503296
what monseigneur said dartagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself	1.2349879741668701
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away  by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence	2.9712884426116943

well the fact is morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself  stay said the young man	1.793173909187317
it was m de villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of m de villefort	1.2433552742004395
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m cavalcanti  give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good  excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40000 francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsementof course i immediately counted him over the forty banknotes  monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent	8.08947467803955
what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers  he had scarcely finished when dartagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time	3.2966904640197754

every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves	1.348757266998291
you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me	1.5330766439437866

where are you taking me he asked	1.1567096710205078
my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf	1.386824607849121

on the contrary observed dartagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible  how so  it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england  well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army	4.360156536102295
in truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die	1.6869862079620361

at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine oclock galloped into the yard of trévilles hôtel	1.551934003829956

neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it	1.826400876045227
in one of these risings the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at	1.7872639894485474
athos never received any letters athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know	1.4498387575149536
thats what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio	1.4579554796218872
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear	1.7609102725982666
i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries	1.6183489561080933
as for m de tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment	2.082183837890625
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world	1.381729006767273
theyre after me was andreas first thought	1.287992238998413
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed	1.4981435537338257
in that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of god rich happy  caderousse smiled bitterly	1.5202428102493286

bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you	1.209976315498352
the sermon over the procurators wife advanced toward the holy font	1.3545600175857544
the first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion	2.3298518657684326
my life belongs to my cash	1.1450603008270264
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m and madame danglars will think me a very illmannered person	1.7274248600006104
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript	1.4657695293426514
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter	1.2845051288604736
the brand disappeared the beauty alone remained	1.2135099172592163
bonacieux dead and to dartagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life	1.3532531261444092
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her  monte cristo started	1.6484119892120361
sure of being killed by athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos	1.5094116926193237
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied dartagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia	1.4959080219268799
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation  why in truth sir was monte cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do	5.702566146850586
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos	1.2176731824874878
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it  the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand	2.259934663772583
come come continued he patting edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain lecleres instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble  0027m    how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer	8.05526065826416
he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust	1.7441195249557495
i am fifteen years younger than he is	1.1617728471755981
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture	1.975841760635376
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest	1.7414170503616333
go and tell m albert that and he may know what to answer you  oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you are right	1.943089485168457
so once more goodnight caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	1.290168285369873
no monsieur it is not aramis and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you  you pardon me cried dartagnan	1.6518088579177856
i shall hear from you  yes  thanks thanks dear love adieu  the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue	1.7081189155578613
the young counts conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long	1.6955996751785278
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	1.149483561515808
we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health dartagnan  to your health repeated porthos and aramis	1.5991021394729614
it was a béarn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without windgalls on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a martingale quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day	3.65267014503479
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone	1.2253071069717407
he was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him	1.8353482484817505
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less	1.7990939617156982
i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that i am become passive in the hands of the almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an eagle	2.0006396770477295
come hither and let us talk  the host approached with hesitation	1.2713762521743774
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged	2.64819598197937
in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads  albert had often heardnot from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangersthe description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him	9.85876178741455
but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind  i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris  when do you propose going thither  have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself  certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there  nay said the count i will give you three months ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties	52.672332763671875
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him	2.244121551513672
i am condemned leave me to my death  my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they cannot make an executioner  what do you mean asked the king	1.834359884262085
good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor	1.5721670389175415
but tell me count will your people take care of my horse  do not alarm yourself my dear maximilianthey understand  i mean because he wants petting	1.7191046476364136
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy	1.42550790309906
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity	2.0849485397338867
you think me rather parsimonious dont you	1.1640751361846924
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared	2.552596092224121
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river  thats well said dartagnan	1.4898979663848877
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	1.2725088596343994
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed	1.8538788557052612
i reasoned thusmoney time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend	2.384551763534546
sometimes their play degenerated into battles and in these battles the king was not always the stronger	1.5766741037368774
the royal procession set out for paris	1.1863843202590942
as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city	1.8563238382339478
has the law any eyes to witness your grief	1.256575584411621
at the footmans announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	1.3931174278259277
what is the matter my dear m mouston asked dartagnan	1.143638014793396
speak then chevalier said the cardinal	1.122122049331665
my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her	2.264310598373413
there is a struggle in nature against this divine substancein nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain	1.6455202102661133
the whole world conspires to break our bonds	1.254313349723816
you are good and faithful servants  athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door	1.9626386165618896
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself	1.185791254043579
i forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me  to the cardinal  what does he want with me  i do not know	1.4387524127960205
the moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment	1.7991526126861572
you are irritated and vexedtell me how this fernand is related to you  he is merely my father said albertm	1.4669076204299927
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty	1.2367489337921143
it was dartagnan who was waiting for him	1.1034103631973267
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest	1.8657007217407227
and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing	1.9874893426895142
and all thisall this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	2.579857587814331
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oftrepeated assurance of the  concierge  that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them	3.5828046798706055
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover	1.3036929368972778
you scoundrel cried dartagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword	1.303412914276123
you will excuse me will you not	1.1156280040740967
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	1.4061610698699951
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much  and i hate her said châteaurenaud	1.3768268823623657
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	1.1832894086837769
where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly	1.2164548635482788
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	5.964736461639404
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high	1.3144229650497437
sire continued m de blacas if it only be to reassure a faithful servant will your majesty send into languedoc provence and dauphiné trusty men who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces   canimus surdis  replied the king continuing the annotations in his horace	3.9308969974517822
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself	2.5298843383789062
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case	1.8314818143844604
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away  20295m    and what did you do with the child asked monte cristo	2.245455026626587
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight	1.240445852279663
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye	1.8580840826034546
what then  ah my dear count said albert	1.1186305284500122
one evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever	2.01529598236084
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor	2.0416150093078613
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and bound	1.8881700038909912
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle	2.9499142169952393
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir  yes and much more  what more will you say  i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you	2.197356700897217
he is leaving them  they are beating the rappel cried chatillon we must discover what is going on  in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the duc de beaufort drew his sword	2.4169697761535645
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him	3.6214661598205566
unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kingsfor kings have need and other persons have fear of you	2.3081648349761963
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving dartagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern	2.615846872329712
sir monk said de guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule all is paid  thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder	2.5001823902130127
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber	1.3988544940948486
your excellency has not stated the number of guests  ah true  how many covers  count for yourself  is everyone here your excellency  yes  bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar	2.035548210144043
dont deny it you were recognized and the cardinal named you	1.2547178268432617
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you knowa cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesnt sympathize with the desires of others	8.445503234863281
but the third time which is the present you may succumb	1.2053263187408447
you know the marquis of saintméran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival  yes said monte cristo i have heard that but as claudius said to hamlet it is a law of nature their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them  but that is not all  not all  no they were going to marry their daughter  to m franz dépinay	6.420990943908691
ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient	1.247126817703247
what had taken place during this long sleep	1.19231379032135
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	1.366109013557434
what are you going to tell me  are we quite alone my friend  yes quite but why all these precautions  because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	1.8713438510894775
the marquis de saintméran i think the concierge said	1.148871660232544
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale	1.3023799657821655
this is something new replied the king	1.1308181285858154
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps  may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself  if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us  youre right yes let us go  on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate	12.276918411254883
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal  but who then is this assassin this murderer  let me also ask you a question	2.6997122764587402
confound you and your punctuality said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host	1.922945261001587
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares14 besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself	3.198347806930542
my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable  he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs	2.961050033569336
i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself  the doctor pressed valentines hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the steps	1.8644882440567017
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss box	1.3307924270629883
what is life to mevery little without you mother for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name	1.9593005180358887
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcanoan extinct volcano before the days when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome	2.4750046730041504
yes happy as myself said he	1.1310683488845825
30297m    at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	4.458995342254639
at the first word the cardinal spoke of mme	1.163774847984314
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	5.653207302093506
then he stepped into his  coupé  calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes	1.4491825103759766
aramis look at that horse  oh the frightful brute said aramis	1.3049554824829102
dartagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him	1.334909200668335
as i told you my dear morrel m de morcerf will kill me  morrel looked at him in utter amazement	1.4622248411178589
but will you not go up  pass on before me i beg of you  as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	2.6198923587799072
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated	1.2627674341201782
at the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his	4.30075740814209
you must be cruelly bored here  that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you  whats that  it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventyfive pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice	4.477804660797119
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de  i know it well  the comtesse de  monsieur porthos be generous  you are right madame and i will not finish  but it was my husband who would not hear of lending  madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory  the procurators wife uttered a groan	3.9857709407806396
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named	1.18722665309906
de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse	1.2562153339385986

but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed  how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance	3.653306007385254

oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sireno grace for the guilty happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it  that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my anger  it is you sire who have now incurred hers	5.341937065124512
and monsieur dartagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur dherblay may i ask if you have any news of him  we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us  no sir i am sure he hasnt yet arrived	2.808082342147827

he said nothing but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me	1.3578540086746216

she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the wavesthat immense breaking of the oceanwith her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans  thou leavest thy servants lord     to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford     thy hand to lead them on   these verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry	12.647913932800293

neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it	1.5229425430297852
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of dartagnan and of athos it must be the best  but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison  egad cried dartagnan hes just the man i count upon	2.4167540073394775

for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard nothing	1.464717984199524

no dont be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and i am anxious that you should love her  the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured	2.3725881576538086

but alas if he was the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of dartagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer	3.677945137023926

suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man	1.3107715845108032
i forgot there were three more steps before the landing  you have hurt yourself perhaps said morrel	1.4493132829666138
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow	1.235273838043213
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages	1.7147117853164673
the cardinalists were three the musketeers lackeys included were seven	1.2596172094345093
i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his actions	1.416756510734558
when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered youmy heart was softened when you arrived here i allowed you to enter	1.6229597330093384
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present	1.6454564332962036
i have already told you answered the abbé that i loathe the idea of shedding blood  and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of selfpreservation  no matter	2.0800297260284424
it is five hundred feet from here in advance said dartagnan	1.2443671226501465
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court	1.4928687810897827
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice  dartagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the guardsman who had just made this insolent speech	3.8778088092803955
i am not a fighting man at all monsieur and i am afraid of the bastille  hum said dartagnan	1.430965781211853
the warm pressure made dartagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself	1.6667749881744385
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was	1.338072419166565
i should affirm the culpability  and i deny it said tréville	1.2070083618164062
put back that weapon dartagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated	1.3954747915267944
what do you mean to say	1.0818064212799072
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord  faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling	1.906759262084961
as dartagnan had foreseen athos was not within	1.2066274881362915
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams	1.4353082180023193
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans  we have no need therefore to say that dartagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheardof things which were taking place	9.446494102478027
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you  i pledge you my word madam said the abbé that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly  ah thats all very fine retorted the woman	3.8289754390716553
will said the notary it is very evident that m noirtier is desirous of making his will  yes yes yes motioned the invalid	1.5910378694534302
is the count shooting in the gallery said morcerf	1.1917423009872437
tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man	1.348536491394043
my lord said dartagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible  that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation	2.2478864192962646
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him	2.0675206184387207
morrel now emerged from his hidingplace where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion	1.5199185609817505
she took the risk upon herself	1.1344436407089233
you asked for candor and you have it	1.1661349534988403
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	1.7107206583023071
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead	1.9229978322982788
for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian	3.479311466217041
she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity	1.2054659128189087
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp	1.2374155521392822
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedalas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where	2.6363046169281006
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought dartagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence  there reigned a perfect stillness in the house	2.5062472820281982
there said dartagnan this is capital	1.1218030452728271
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars  née  hermine de servieux  albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess	4.124269008636475
oh no said kitty it is not me you love	1.1723395586013794
he did not dare to write for fear of not being ableto such experienced eyes as those of miladyto disguise his writing sufficiently	1.776318907737732
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them	2.636859655380249
the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed	1.2024554014205933
but not before one oclock replied dartagnan	1.1434588432312012
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september 1646	1.4706568717956543
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am	1.306226372718811
listen said he i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned the doctor turned pale	2.074319362640381
shall i tell you each ornament of your toilet	1.2245473861694336
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone	1.6593899726867676
without doubt aramis is one of my best friends  aramis	1.2317909002304077
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what carlini had done	1.480971097946167
it is my dear valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering  40280m    i said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead	1.603459119796753
most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers     chapter 42	1.769727349281311
milady seemed overcome with joy and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the  soubrette  with de wardes when he received the letter how he had responded what was the expression of his face if he seemed very amorous	2.663907051086426
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night  scoundrel murmured felton	2.6659762859344482
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed	1.2156063318252563
the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was fernand that of my betrothed wasstay stay continued the abbé i have forgotten what he called her  mercédès said caderousse eagerly	2.1135973930358887
what the devil are you doing here count  accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee	1.572678804397583
who is in command here asked the cardinal	1.1605770587921143
he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion	1.4664723873138428
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds	1.4168833494186401
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot	1.3725730180740356
a propos  inform bazin  will bazin go with us asked aramis	1.3311808109283447
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us	1.9244461059570312
humph murmured athos it is certainly she  and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady	1.5866330862045288
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow  as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains	2.84073543548584
he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity	1.8285670280456543
deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde	1.8983409404754639
and did you catch any of his words  i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect	1.4312129020690918
at last  do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you	1.3025118112564087
you do not know her replied the stranger	1.126528263092041
but hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen	1.9167338609695435
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents	1.2488397359848022
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	2.2932112216949463
you have seen your dream realized  i can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor benedetto is richhe has an annuity  well you have an annuity  i have  40134m    yes since i bring you your two hundred francs  caderousse shrugged his shoulders	2.6723694801330566
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison	1.8308632373809814
one word more sir do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m cavalcanti will bring without touching the money	1.7911843061447144
the man took his way toward the city	1.1390680074691772
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens	1.2971488237380981
what is that exclaimed the queen	1.0803872346878052
the thirtytwo that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead  that is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses  you see i travel with them  but you are not always travelling  when i no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale  but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them  then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects  count may i suggest one idea to you  certainly  it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe  you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a franc in his possession  then he must be a wonder	34.95710372924805
send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of monsieur de chavigny well have a supper here under your direction  hum said la ramee	1.7488226890563965
i cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday  oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rivals attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernandhe was ghastly pale	7.348147392272949
but  à propos  resumed m de tréville what has become of your three companions  i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them  none monsieur  well i left them on my roadporthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining  see there now said m de tréville and how the devil did you escape  by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry  there again	9.27474308013916
follow him said villefort to dantès	1.1220624446868896
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty	1.7902190685272217
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber	2.3291079998016357
the husband had presided at the abduction of his wife	1.2238261699676514
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale	1.5894562005996704
speak  madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart	2.100499391555786
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose	3.1842477321624756
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	1.2724274396896362
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned	6.105861663818359
that great man who was so revered by dartagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back	2.234328031539917
why on board the tartan replied the sailor	1.2297844886779785
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point	2.459092140197754
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris  it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters	4.927717685699463
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him	1.4607150554656982
come come said andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow there is no occasion to make such a fuss since i give myself up and he held out his hands to be manacled	1.9010846614837646
remember your promise  in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and dartagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and antechamber	1.7575851678848267
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of   since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them	1.9415810108184814
he went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace	1.276851773262024
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé  this was the orthodox phrase	1.5176267623901367
0311m    edmond preserved the most admirable selfcommand not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as  la jeune amélie  had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn	3.9492247104644775
how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason	1.723715901374817
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart  ennui  can find no place  you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace	3.9620437622070312
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning around	1.3673343658447266
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masters guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill dartagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of dartagnan or rather of planchet after dartagnan had saved his life	4.59805154800415
eh monsieur said he addressing dartagnan dont you remember that face which is blinking yonder  no said dartagnan and yet i am certain it is not the first time i have seen that visage   parbleu  i believe it is not said planchet	2.1615540981292725
himself my lord  but he is said to be a furious mazarinist  phew whistled planchet	1.3426390886306763
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look	1.2976608276367188
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house	1.2618036270141602
m de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair	1.3745660781860352
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	1.2402485609054565
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt	1.4130502939224243
the man of meung  chapter xv	1.1165966987609863
the duke of buckingham and his english masters of the isle of ré continued to besiege but without success the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée and hostilities with la rochelle had commenced two or three days before about a fort which the duc dangoulême had caused to be constructed near the city	3.4930126667022705
once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queens  the three gentlemen then shook hands lord de winter taking the rue saint honore and athos and aramis remaining together	2.1490509510040283
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting  oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers	3.4325814247131348
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme	1.321468472480774
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres	1.3062918186187744
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur dartagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen	1.7662018537521362
will you permit me to inquire said madame de villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here  no i do not replied monte cristo it is a small place i have purchased quite lately	2.1999683380126953
dartagnan held the bridle of athoss horse and porthos that of aramis	1.2329593896865845
i see you no longeri am dyinghelp me	1.157594084739685
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the facevalue of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis	2.9318878650665283
felton my brother my friend i conjure you  no cried felton no you shall live and you shall be avenged  felton i bring misfortune to all who surround me	1.8574267625808716
and now you are assembled gentlemen said dartagnan permit me to offer you my apologies  at this word  apologies  a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis	2.6896073818206787
a waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony	1.658711314201355
the man who abducted my wife  the cardinal rang a second time	1.261224627494812
on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was maitre bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master	2.1539628505706787
against whom do they cry out	1.172298550605774
had morrel been a more quicksighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the kings procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department	2.7297403812408447
or dreamed he was and awoke mad  after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here  so the matter ended for the abbé faria	1.8535889387130737
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him	1.367019772529602
what are you thinking about said the king go on my good parry unless you are tired  parry resumed his reading	1.58823823928833
there is your proud and selfish nature	1.1761865615844727
but what is going on in this accursed paris  what is going on my lord	1.3343099355697632
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged	1.987333059310913
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed	1.2347763776779175
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration	1.5143810510635376
yes gentlemen in the kings room	1.1127045154571533
decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you  gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his man  i cover mine said dartagnan	2.783144950866699
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him	1.3205201625823975
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning  in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	3.2513339519500732
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical	2.0274956226348877
this is not a corsican  maquis  but an english garden badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that  monsieur i implore you do not stay there  i think you are going mad bertuccio said the count coldly	2.452983856201172
each was accompanied by two priests	1.1556953191757202
yes the priest  oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before  was it ever known who this miserable fellow was  he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady	3.0291147232055664
we must play the farce to the end	1.1317596435546875
march forward  but eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of henry iv	1.4814037084579468
i am at least fearful of it	1.1176481246948242
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity	1.3210278749465942
he desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger	1.734938144683838
i have only one thing to say to you	1.1367844343185425
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door	1.3858495950698853
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea	1.7452092170715332

but i dined at m de villeforts and lawyers always give you very bad dinners	1.4072370529174805
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i cannot comprehend  indeed  yes  well then tell him this rochefort	1.5345386266708374
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up  and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt  it is for that reason you see me so early  because you have the order of charles iii and you wish to announce the good news to me  no because i passed the night writing lettersfiveandtwenty despatches	3.920238971710205
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias  now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities	1.7692651748657227
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular	1.5140644311904907
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news	1.1561408042907715

he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure	2.030829429626465
what do you say asked his wife pale as death	1.213125467300415
she read  it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone	1.3861535787582397
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti  i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris  is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo	4.993307113647461

morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant	1.3813303709030151
but first of all i must get there  he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo	1.4137763977050781
dartagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the most mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts	2.355201244354248
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end  ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent  this reproof stung athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing dartagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying  i am not calumniating you my friend	8.404842376708984
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme	1.2950234413146973
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word	1.783921241760254
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawingrooms  come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light  that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying	3.8097805976867676

i love you so tenderly that i cannot help being jealous even of the past  a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen	1.7135868072509766
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question	1.2009210586547852
the mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it	2.3554980754852295
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love  you alarm me cried franz	1.4112440347671509

and driving the coadjutors carriage said the queen	1.1786223649978638
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors	2.8410446643829346
dartagnan looked and was seized with pleasure	1.1525955200195312
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well	1.4564406871795654

the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that dartagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty  soubrette  perceiving his presence	1.836206078529358
when you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it  i believe you are right  i am glad of it  then i will go alone  go but you would do better still by not going at all  that is impossible  do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed  but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second  my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you  why  perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons  well i will have franz and châteaurenaud they will be the very men for it  do so then  but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing  that too is impossible  what a singular being you areyou will not interfere in anything  you are rightthat is the principle on which i wish to act  we will say no more about it then	161.99978637695312
although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked	1.2111047506332397
the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man	1.4801243543624878
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives	1.375664472579956

dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	1.8094029426574707
i do not understand you  so much the better i have a ray of hope left listen  i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze	2.3336596488952637
as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity	2.507767677307129
you do not madame at least i hope not	1.1694210767745972
are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existencemy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum	7.262336254119873
oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer	2.359994411468506
yes  and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father  noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may  maximilian understood him	2.079636335372925
and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself  i should my dear dartagnan have been so but nature said no when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her again if she smiles i smile too	2.9110183715820312
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it	1.3572611808776855
you have perhaps no money   perhaps  is too much said dartagnan smiling	1.2389689683914185
as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct  what a madcap i was and what a stupid fellow i am	3.7630980014801025
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort	1.2903050184249878

here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonadesellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it	2.8794260025024414
let us return to your apartment	1.1167365312576294

is that all  yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity	1.541007399559021
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside and the young man went to the gangway	1.7295089960098267
for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room	1.7859625816345215
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt	1.3794918060302734
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and drink	1.3718376159667969
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies	1.5380597114562988
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to enter	1.4529205560684204
for tell me where can you find a love like minea love which neither time nor absence nor despair can extinguish a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon a stray look or a chance word	2.797874689102173

40086m    well baron said he here i am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed  morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker	4.5292253494262695
oh heavens continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now  the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward	1.9358125925064087
nay it must have been a promise  a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh  let them answered dartagnan	1.5702074766159058
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated  explain yourself said grimaud	1.4491994380950928

it was about eleven oclock at night	1.1332669258117676
with what view  with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham  dartagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation	1.6938998699188232

you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii	1.787306308746338
no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almightys pleasure  dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbés plans	3.4749598503112793
go valentine said madame de saintméran and leave me with this gentleman  but grandmamma  leave mego  the young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes at the door she found the valet de chambre who told her that the doctor was waiting in the diningroom	2.5330092906951904

i begin and without any rhetoric  allow me porthos said aramis	1.2297991514205933
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans heart	1.457411766052246
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile	1.2992947101593018
no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of it  it is much more convenient at pariswhen anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly  that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel  but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel	10.751209259033203
we will escape and if we cannot escape we will talk you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love	1.5374736785888672

he continued  so i was going away but he called me back	1.2490630149841309
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into eugénie became uneasy	4.032698154449463
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative	1.2165231704711914
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted	1.647949457168579
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart	1.9531497955322266

he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	1.3534438610076904
light me i am going to the queen  bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way	1.382919430732727
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain	2.0149645805358887
he could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of grief	1.3930071592330933
the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl	1.713118076324463

you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination	2.626828193664551
i am lost murmured she i am lost	1.1264601945877075
you will find me ready to follow you  they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin dartagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens	2.276048421859741
dont be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	1.3676843643188477
milady looked at this man and hesitated	1.1149086952209473
parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it respectfully	1.3006997108459473
i think i hear a noise she said leave me  goodbye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with gratitude	2.5786237716674805
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating  the notary the notary  m de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother	2.1715564727783203
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden	1.6789429187774658
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil bertuccio slightly started	1.5491421222686768
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion	1.8775501251220703
imagine to yourself a don quixote of eighteen a don quixote without his corselet without his coat of mail without his cuisses a don quixote clothed in a woolen doublet the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure face long and brown high cheek bones a sign of sagacity the maxillary muscles enormously developed an infallible sign by which a gascon may always be detected even without his capand our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather the eye open and intelligent the nose hooked but finely chiseled	16.807584762573242
a year after madame  well  i wanted to see the good curé again	1.343503475189209
the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the righthand crypt belonging to the saintméran family	1.705647587776184
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road  the devil he does	2.0600061416625977
there is not one of those women egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor  really said madame de villefort whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation	3.0858075618743896
the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing	2.1313438415527344
when they reached the street aramis said  well athos what do you think  of whom  pardieu	1.4441297054290771
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends	1.7264947891235352
oh muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond	1.2432533502578735
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope	1.6757704019546509
stay here if you like but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently  but we cannot swim to the shore  the longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca	2.0888969898223877
has anyone brought a letter for me asked dartagnan eagerly	1.2694671154022217
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence	1.2297751903533936
for you must indeed be a great chemist and the elixir you administered to my son which recalled him to life almost instantaneously  30077m    oh do not place any reliance on that madame  one  drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was ten would have destroyed him	9.362237930297852
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saintjacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and pale	5.418761730194092
sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer	2.6736392974853516
i descended rapidly although i had not seen villeforts face i recognized him by the beating of my heart	1.4747246503829956
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m de villefort     chapter 52	1.9630359411239624
see john see how well she knows how to handle a knife  in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will	2.9448401927948
alas returned villefort i must  where then are you going asked the marquise	1.3392333984375
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket	1.3710408210754395
this beverage required a good halfhour to prepare	1.2173155546188354
the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves wolves or scoundrels often against nobles or huguenots sometimes against the king but never against the cardinal or spain	2.326632261276245
m de tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen	1.270133376121521
morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw	1.3803988695144653
monsieur said mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master phoebus could no longer hold out and  silence said porthos	1.8678926229476929
he embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed emmanuels hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for cocles	1.9081699848175049
and perhaps his saddle therewith  no gentlemen i have kept the harness said porthos	1.3966693878173828
i will return soon to learn the result of your trip  the stranger went out	1.3427780866622925
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrinis side	1.7634104490280151
buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love	1.8346542119979858
i will go by the way of boulogne to clear the way athos will set out two hours after by that of amiens aramis will follow us by that of noyon as to dartagnan he will go by what route he thinks is best in planchets clothes while planchet will follow us like dartagnan in the uniform of the guards  gentlemen said athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair	5.593316555023193
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission  the young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself	1.871042251586914
if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardonable  the procurators wife was piqued	1.7063262462615967
if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this nightbut supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother	2.162418842315674
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known	1.6819570064544678
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are	1.4385062456130981
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon	1.4907840490341187
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressingroom which led by a side staircase down to the yardeugénie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle darmilly scarcely raised with both hands	3.613757371902466
come in come in monsieur porthos  the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity	2.1982338428497314
when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not beforebe careful about thisforce open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive  perhaps exclaimed dantès in griefstricken tones	3.6577491760253906
open sir she said and look for yourself  mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze	2.243818759918213
the corpse of madame de villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony	2.4467427730560303
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal	1.8168330192565918
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal  lower	1.3693428039550781
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian  oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my life  then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair  no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife  poor fellow what is it  my grief will kill me of itself  my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me	7.302649974822998
besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash ones self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power	1.9876574277877808
all that which a man wounded in his selflove could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurators wife	2.1548216342926025
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur dartagnan say a great deal about them  you know monsieur dartagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes	2.090082883834839
then the postscript  well what of the postscript  then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter  certainly the abbé busoni and myself have a small account open between us	2.282942771911621
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace  yes said dartagnan till she comes out  ah my faith said athos you require too much dartagnan	1.8511897325515747
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash	1.9296015501022339
he was incessantly attacked by them and the superior to whom he had confided this misfortune wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them had advised him in order to conjure away the tempting demon to have recourse to the bell rope and ring with all his might	3.4100539684295654
my fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared	4.678568363189697
i will be with you directly  the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	1.5955947637557983
my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability  morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz	6.69296932220459
you are my friend today tomorrow you will be no more to me than a shadow or rather even you will no longer exist	1.5270248651504517
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room	1.4321967363357544
this malady admits but of one remedy i will tell you what that is	1.3566936254501343
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eventpoor girl so young so rich so beautiful	1.7826495170593262
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinals party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queenmother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinala confidence which he had so well earnedhe received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queens apartments	9.781858444213867
all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way	1.3341749906539917
they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate	2.140080690383911
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos	1.9866737127304077
châteaurenaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saintgermain do not pay any attention to him countlive in the chaussée dantin thats the real centre of paris  boulevard de lopéra said beauchamp the second floora house with a balcony	2.674513816833496
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all  he will play me some dogs trick or other and that immediately said tréville	3.5422773361206055
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	1.257840633392334
as for the théatre français you know of course that it is nowhere	1.3308231830596924
you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head	1.212042212486267
no no be easy on that score	1.1678818464279175
bonacieux therefore ask my own secrets and i will reveal them to you but those of othersthat is quite another thing  very well said dartagnan i shall discover them as these secrets may have an influence over your life these secrets must become mine  beware of what you do cried the young woman in a manner so serious as to make dartagnan start in spite of himself	4.206980228424072
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing  decidedly my dear athos said dartagnan i should like better not to risk anything  thats a pity said athos coolly	2.4569830894470215
i recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak  the devil said athos musingly	1.3163797855377197
it was given to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday near the gate st honoré  no upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman i bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name porthos	3.0719010829925537
have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming  ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence	3.0881054401397705
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthoss nor aramiss and as to athos he had none	1.6436408758163452
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot	1.9295225143432617
or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied athos	1.2772223949432373
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and cannot justify himself  i accuse no one sir said danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you  does the count know what answer you received  yes i showed it to him  did he know my fathers christian name was fernand and his family name mondego  yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less	7.556264877319336
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it	1.4497085809707642
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste  then cried franz it is hashish	11.172019004821777
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope	1.7132002115249634
dartagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right	1.4189825057983398
joy shone in raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle	1.338754653930664
the concert must be a delightful one  they suit each other remarkably well said danglars	1.4288264513015747
really m de blacas i must change your armorial bearings i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this device tenax   0133m    sire i listen said de blacas biting his nails with impatience	3.5540497303009033
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation	1.2471189498901367
and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydées apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son  haydée said morrel what has become of her  she departed last night  to leave you  to wait for me	2.547255754470825
i have brought away ten or twelve wounded	1.1934717893600464
monsieur de beaufort escaped  my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace  and you did not fire on him  he was out of range  monsieur de chavignywhere was he  absent  and la ramee  was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him  but the man who was under him  was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with him  mazarin groaned	4.343100547790527
it is not of my wife i hope  on the contrary it is of her	1.2224746942520142
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departednot however without walking several times to the door of the pressroom as if he had half a mind to enter	3.047645330429077
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question	1.4125919342041016
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness	1.4898043870925903
then another important thing raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses	2.878492593765259
he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful	1.6724032163619995
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence	2.9740729331970215
madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed  i cannot believe it the thing is impossible  i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said  turning impatiently towards her husband madame danglars demanded is this true  is what true madame inquired danglars visibly agitated	2.705657958984375
in what a tone you speak cried valentine	1.1551545858383179
as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices	2.8756885528564453
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean	1.8754301071166992
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth  and yet said dartagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make  sorties  and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans	2.649857521057129
immediately the aldermen clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants each holding a  flambeau  in his hand went to attend upon the king whom they met on the steps where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcomea compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late laying the blame upon the cardinal who had detained him till eleven oclock talking of affairs of state	6.056874752044678
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside  oh no	1.4224425554275513
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses	1.3157966136932373
all i can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance	2.5524301528930664
dantès noticed that the captain of  la jeune amélie  had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so	2.3279831409454346
the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage	1.5097856521606445
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	2.2224647998809814
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there  30269m    the chest no longer there murmured madame danglars choking with fear	2.143237352371216
god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home  poor valentine  i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless	4.308552265167236
the affair was not long i assure you	1.1541283130645752
aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls	1.5952281951904297
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles	1.3516526222229004
well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it  go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love and that i love you morrel  40260m    i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid	7.448825359344482
come come said porthos jump in  but monsieur said mousqueton i cant swim let me stay here  and me too monsieur said blaisois	1.5845876932144165
as usual valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them	1.5124483108520508
do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand	1.6497329473495483
in fact the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman and he awaited with impatience the moment always in the future when aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock	2.2663614749908447
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously	2.1635119915008545
do you still fence well  ii fence as well as you did in the old timebetter still perhaps i do nothing else all day  and with whom  with an excellent masteratarms that we have here  what	2.119014024734497
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife	4.469533920288086
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door himself	1.3073689937591553
but how do you know all this  how do i know it  yes how do you know it	1.327752709388733
do you aramis order the servants	1.1451369524002075
yesyour friend at least hopes so  come upstairs with me and i will give it to you  i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	1.670499563217163
i wish i had never seen you cried dartagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason	2.5003175735473633
what is to be done  my god my god murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you monsieur	1.4799482822418213
thats a snare said athos dont go dartagnan  and yet replied dartagnan i think i recognize the writing  it may be counterfeit said athos	1.5088917016983032

it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond	1.2845745086669922

well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow  hush said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of mordauntit will bring bad luck and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by aramis	3.761927843093872

my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled  albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror	11.082437515258789
