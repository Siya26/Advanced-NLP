he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen the second to avert the death of a great king  sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen  i wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases  do what monsieur de la fere requests that is your name is it not sir  i have another name madamei am called athos  madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfilled  you hear sir said the queen	4.707737922668457
dartagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the enemy	1.5209307670593262
at auteuil near paris  m de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid	1.4665085077285767
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawingroom now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea	2.369579315185547
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabitedthe only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count	2.2073147296905518
dartagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed	1.356943130493164
at last they reached the tennis court	1.1137266159057617
the duke porthos and dartagnan roared out both at once	1.1490362882614136
why to converse with him of course	1.0993552207946777
0189m    dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall	1.3664532899856567
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one	1.3584240674972534
yes but listen this was not all	1.0978788137435913
well asked peppino of his friend	1.078814148902893
madame say that you would love me then	1.1150367259979248
madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep	1.3487988710403442
but after his bath asked morcerf	1.0912647247314453
aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather sharply	1.3433425426483154
the king has nothing like it  no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin	1.367218255996704
i have not yet had time to see him again	1.1143569946289062
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right dartagnan mouston will do mouston has a very fine appearance  dartagnan smiled	1.4836479425430298
oh he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans	1.245774269104004
give me the letter  how can you read asked athos it is as dark as a cold oven  wait said bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted waxlight with which he started the church candles	1.9247710704803467
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden	1.2624307870864868
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors	1.3103907108306885
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne	1.2964082956314087
your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand  go on then replied the count	1.4001539945602417
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake  what happened during the night asked beauchamp of châteaurenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here  in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron	2.9438905715942383
i have nothing to save for your majesty you are only the victim of perfidious plots  that is true that is true my child said the queen you are right  give me then that letter madame time presses  the queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and pens	2.0805768966674805
the closet into which dartagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawingroom where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	2.233243465423584
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast	1.2666553258895874
a slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to dartagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his life	1.705806016921997
aha cried dartagnan theyre coming toward us  so much the worse for them said porthos	1.2542901039123535
fontrailles his aidedecamp had an arm broken his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by pain	1.4631823301315308
come calm yourself and reckon them upm	1.1582893133163452
nonsense cried dartagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well i know an excellent method  what  i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted  and then asked mazarin turning pale	1.796844720840454
in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn child	1.1912094354629517
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened	1.2669965028762817
here i am  wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us  why all these precautions  you shall know  milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	1.8465882539749146
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	1.117492914199829
he followed m dépinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then reenter with albert and châteaurenaud	1.3137781620025635
here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel	1.199190378189087
madame said villefort i ask where is m davrigny	1.1028889417648315
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peaceoffering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame	4.202049255371094
you see i give you a wide range	1.1204800605773926
indeed thought porthos casting a glance at the three hungry clerksfor the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousins place i would not keep such gourmands	1.9379005432128906
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen	1.317686676979065
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant	1.293252944946289
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert	1.1525620222091675
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamondhilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	2.24094295501709
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified	1.1943670511245728
the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter	1.9354461431503296
anne of austria took two steps forward	1.1243842840194702
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to	1.5846610069274902
even his breathing seemed to be arrested	1.119272232055664
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand  i maintain my original resolution  very well my dear sir then i consent to cut throats with you	3.121128559112549
reflect upon it  dartagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that dartagnan carried into everything	1.560531735420227
he is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	1.202143907546997
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds gone	1.2489608526229858
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it	1.4007608890533447
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte  yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if possible  quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters  halloo there cried aramis turning around what a noise behind us  a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon	2.9193410873413086
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment  still my lord i cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and i cant travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts  mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to dartagnan  take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey  if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought dartagnan we shall yet be able to do business together he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	12.927754402160645
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder	1.099269151687622
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters empty  then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest	2.4570629596710205
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live said aramis	1.1993073225021362
over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a fulllength portrait of anne of austria so perfect in its resemblance that dartagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it	1.9684739112854004
let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said beauchamp let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes  yes yes said albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our childrens children and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to youfor had this been known oh beauchamp i should have destroyed myself orno my poor mother	4.476497650146484
dartagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error	1.2347030639648438
at length the reading of the indictment was ended	1.1261160373687744
well if you do not go this very instant i will have you arrested by the queens orders and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much  bonacieux fell into a profound reflection	1.6760530471801758
well said the prisoner when the door was shut i am not so far advanced as i believed	1.2708359956741333
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat	1.5110124349594116
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	1.407566785812378
you have no money coming in on which you can rely  none  you have exhausted every resource  all  and in half an hour said maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored  blood washes out dishonor said morrel	1.8824071884155273

i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter	1.2987334728240967
40262m    until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down	1.2826166152954102
informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the kings countenance m de tréville felt himself something like samson before the philistines	1.509460210800171
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as dartagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas  yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now  oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time	2.691800117492676
i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests	1.2667351961135864

he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared  at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe	2.3036446571350098
this idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that i now bear the punishment  continue continue said felton i am eager to see you attain your vengeance  oh i resolved that it should take place as soon as possible	2.0056629180908203

m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character	1.8054258823394775
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain  oh it is terrible and m de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father	2.1922171115875244
bazin was their only attendant for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton	1.2833164930343628
yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet	1.2331442832946777
the dailyrenewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeera service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy	1.6676641702651978
a young man does not require luxuries besides i know what travelling is  with a postchaise and valet de chambre  any way mother  well be it so	1.5279821157455444
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses	1.2441567182540894
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window	1.460182547569275
and gabrielle destreesas goodnatured as brave as proud and above all as gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated	1.4432029724121094
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but i conjure you do not abandon me	1.5825166702270508

monsieur the governor was all astonishment	1.0849084854125977
devils coachman cried friquet youre meddling too	1.226034164428711
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead  without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the icecold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hidingplace the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside	30.666799545288086
i am mistaken  monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him  no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me	1.952872395515442
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentines confidence and knew all their secrets morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light	1.6914671659469604
there is no god there is no providenceall comes by chance  there is a providence there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him  but who are you then asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count	3.2004268169403076
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference	1.1378262042999268
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage	1.2678213119506836
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubtedthat is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands  and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see  it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future  then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister  we have not thought about it yet madame answered dartagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly  i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants  alas madame exclaimed dartagnan this proves to me that not till today has your majesty had a just idea of us  perhaps said anne but that idea if at last i have it  your majesty will do us justice	23.25884246826172
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters	1.1618468761444092
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner  have you a spanish prisoner cried the prince	1.300420880317688
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road	1.6447248458862305
the reference is no doubt to the  wistaria frutescens ed	1.2079792022705078

yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us  but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors  bah	2.3036885261535645

he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	1.2032908201217651
oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impaired said villefort	1.2819522619247437
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune  then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value  why everything is relative answered the abbé	3.7113046646118164
scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sons room and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed	1.3749306201934814
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house	1.4720957279205322

save your skin begone quickly  dartagnan did not budge	1.2022554874420166
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling	1.2766371965408325
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows  and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo inquiringly	2.530806064605713

without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that dartagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois	1.845852017402649
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger  what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host	1.5379083156585693

his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba  then said monte cristo you went to him  monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out	2.328770637512207

the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and i have heard nothing of either of them since	1.3541288375854492

we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches	1.2182128429412842

they halted for the king to dine	1.0794094800949097
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	1.5045387744903564
you have decided friend said athos	1.0662869215011597
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips	1.2819232940673828
porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn	1.4458887577056885
the major will bring his son with him this evening the  contino  as we say in italy he confides him to my care	1.4288225173950195
no more than a drop of water in the ocean  remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow  how so inquired the abbé	1.5855070352554321
the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base	1.2009644508361816
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled	1.0988284349441528
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose	1.3825136423110962
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini	1.3837769031524658
monsieur dartagnan said the commissary addressing athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur  but cried bonacieux this is not monsieur dartagnan whom you show me  what	1.5336281061172485
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered	1.156376600265503

well i swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethunewas he not of bethuneyes egad	1.2780554294586182

directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m danglars trembled too  morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this cannot be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartismi mean about the year 1815  yes replied m danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner  indeed answered maximilian and what did your father say then valentine  oh such a dreadful thing that i dont dare to tell you  always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile	12.521897315979004

père pamphile more wine  and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table	1.2292550802230835

mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers	1.8387516736984253
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished	1.3697776794433594

de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection	1.4215004444122314
and is the reason known  no  how extraordinary	1.15420401096344
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds  oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you  i shall take better care of them myself answered dartagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape	3.3224077224731445
i have not a penny about me  you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms  which  that which i found at your feet and replaced in your pocket  hold your tongue imprudent man	1.6741077899932861

i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival  and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards monte cristo appeared on the threshold	1.4934128522872925
he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forestalled	1.2572122812271118
on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation	1.2124361991882324
dartagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life	1.6776354312896729
he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear	1.239202857017517
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how illformed are your objections to valentines marriage  noirtier answered only by a look which made villeforts blood run cold	1.7765040397644043

as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master	2.3623085021972656
therefore dartagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	2.160569429397583
they stopped at the sign of the fox in the rue du vieux colombier a tavern known for many years by athos and asked for two bedrooms	1.5257643461227417
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	1.2361928224563599
m noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night	1.4981273412704468
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her	1.1972241401672363
tomorrow at the hôtel field of the cloth of gold a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply   oh said dartagnan this is rather warm it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person	1.909870982170105

madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her	1.5479718446731567
this event might have three causes  the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majestys guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a wellfurnished purse in his pocket	1.9622478485107422
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	1.2955702543258667

bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of dartagnan	1.1313387155532837

he consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded man	1.475577473640442
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door	1.2496000528335571

de guiche who was young and impulsive said to raoul here we are three masters and three servants	1.3458430767059326
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude  and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	1.724047303199768

no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and dartagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever	1.4600621461868286

on their way they met grimaud	1.0757122039794922

the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity	1.8094912767410278
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead  m	1.1735484600067139

i told you on the contrary  take away the prisoner said the commissary to the two guards	1.2168662548065186

as to dartagnan he took care not to give the least sign of existence	1.2111304998397827
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating ladys men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day the  bonnes fortunes  of de tréville were talked of as those of m de bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before and that was not saying a little	2.9860358238220215
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois	1.1791913509368896

what cried dartagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos  yes that disturbs you  by no means  and here is the second  dartagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis	1.6389893293380737
there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house	1.2909754514694214
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother  then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm  may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos	1.7043570280075073
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you  and you have me my lord	1.369941234588623
dartagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step	1.498386025428772
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible	1.5261077880859375
besides the eyes of the gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the dark	1.3715201616287231
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises  charles had heard and understood it all	1.5545954704284668
at this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door	1.140321969985962
but then you understand madame coquenard a mule with feathers and bells  be satisfied said the procurators wife	1.3239588737487793
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers	1.1354707479476929
it cannot be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts	1.765596628189087
dartagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task	1.1578067541122437
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known	1.4910041093826294
thats true replied dartagnan i have not the uniform but i have the spirit	1.172827959060669
we have met him twice at general cromwells	1.129051685333252
the baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and m andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jackinthebox	1.6390928030014038
a friend a friend said peppino but where is the captain  there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings	1.9314998388290405
do you know the decision we have come to mother  have we come to any  yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercédès sighed	2.2722346782684326
dartagnan hearing the musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of it	1.4869087934494019
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten	1.157401204109192
do you require my services now asked davrigny	1.1160097122192383
what forthat they may try a month hence to marry me again and to whomm	1.2362775802612305
i have during those fiveandtwenty years spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms  sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure	3.4627978801727295
ah said aramis but you forget the officer  dartagnan grew pale with rage	1.1867178678512573
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	1.1883467435836792
the host fearful of consequences with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him	1.551438808441162
it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood  theres only one remedy dear raoulthat is to marry her as a compensation remarked dartagnan	1.6056156158447266
very well done  the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him	1.3626848459243774
dartagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase	1.3390063047409058
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	2.240145683288574
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame  oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much  perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant  i shall borrow from the queen  but her majesty has no property interposed aramis	2.469635486602783
the emeticis it come yet no one answered	1.1240930557250977
grimaud he cried remain i wish it  then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed he saluted and made a movement to depart	1.4912317991256714
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government  mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondys suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression  madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinals hat seems to belong already to his noble brow  ah	5.465510368347168
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness	1.2791688442230225
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	1.1575959920883179
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	1.2496217489242554
six of his eminences guards arrest six of his majestys musketeers	1.2073732614517212
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends  there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis	1.7254105806350708
take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and i repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness  0351m    oh sir said caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his browoh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man  i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feelings	3.211571455001831
neither dared for some time to speak in that room	1.172589659690857
goodday commander  ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him	1.3168601989746094
the house may be suspected but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur dartagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal  was it not this dartagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmesdéchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation	3.474186897277832
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	1.5659905672073364
i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with long service  here haydée cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative	1.825668454170227
my dear m lucien said madame danglars through the door you are always complaining that eugénie will not address a word to you  madame said lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house expected to be caressed i am not the only one who makes similar complaints i think i heard morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed  true said madame danglars yet i think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study  my study  at least that of the minister  why so  to ask for an engagement at the opera	5.095731735229492
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string	1.6020174026489258
grimaud said athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands  oh the great man cried dartagnan	1.8311065435409546
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets	1.448797345161438
they were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it	1.3983778953552246
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto	1.2941875457763672
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait  yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners  bah said athos	1.5282090902328491
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear dartagnan  what	1.1260015964508057
enter gentlemen enter said the queen	1.1182773113250732
broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings officers	1.347949743270874
then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress	2.279064416885376
my dear dartagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn  my faith said dartagnan with great pleasure	1.7010701894760132
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers	1.5337029695510864
he will not go today said dartagnan but here ill pay you for us two  in that case let us go said the shipmaster	1.3867418766021729
my vocation commands me it carries me away  dartagnan smiled but made no answer	1.2744556665420532
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank	1.4976776838302612
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind	1.2154515981674194
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of dartagnan	1.5829662084579468
but once started he could not stop	1.108353614807129
dartagnan thought of all these matters	1.092699646949768
she had laid that down the preceding evening	1.11434006690979
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse  the three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances	2.2883994579315186
then they did not watch over this man	1.089644193649292
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galleyslave on his deathbed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion	1.7137643098831177
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight  what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	2.8261640071868896
now said dartagnan you wouldnt be sorry to understand the plot would you porthos  well no not very  well then we shall go down into the court  yes  we shall take the place of those two fellows  well  we will walk back and forth  thats a good idea for it isnt warm  in a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day before  and we shall answer  no on the contrary we shall not answer  as you please i dont insist on answering  we will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence  where shall we escort him  where he is goingto visit athos	5.6868062019348145
evidently he did not understand his meaning	1.0973230600357056
and the disappearance of his money how am i to justify it if i am here  you are right we must go out  go out	1.3998756408691406
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table	1.9366869926452637
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances	1.817570447921753
what interest have they in your death	1.1054432392120361
then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner	1.229109525680542
bravery is always respected even in an enemy	1.1510953903198242
where is the countwhere is haydée  look said jacopo	1.1515313386917114
is supper ready signor pastrini  yes your excellency  well then let us sup  but the carriage and horses said franz	1.3506360054016113
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor	1.565383791923523
he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor	1.7322145700454712
andrea cavalcanti  the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawingroom and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously	1.769036889076233
the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal  ah mercymercy cried caderousse	1.4858492612838745
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table	1.3422739505767822
instead of going direct to his study m morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting	1.3362386226654053
he had entered villeforts office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand	1.8601598739624023
it is for you replied a gendarme	1.0759614706039429
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rosetrees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season	2.88510799407959
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more halfpistoles in any way  perhaps replied dartagnan	1.293718934059143
yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return  you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her  and what said the abbé asked athos	3.0698134899139404
this is recent news sir continued she and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter i should not have heard till tomorrow perhaps after tomorrowthe last of all paris  madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian  your guardian	3.418222427368164
it would be very kind of you  no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter  a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be  are we alone  yes replied the count going to the door and returning	1.9935798645019531
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh	1.60673987865448
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him  faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here  tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him  the servant bowed and retired	2.7617862224578857
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows	1.8480459451675415
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewherehave i not obeyed	1.5106927156448364
i will see the queen i will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt ignorant	1.3138084411621094
it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion	1.9578440189361572
oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists sayour masters in everythingthose favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities  but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law	4.926342964172363
its little enough  but so it is  no it cannot be  are you my friend caderousse  yes in life or death  well i will tell you a secret  what is it  but remember  ah	1.5996252298355103
we shall go out all the same  do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands  no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed  it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked  what then  why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at  and what have master pastrycooks to do with us  we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us	4.640862941741943
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all  he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	2.3555920124053955
he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saintmartin and to be going towards the madeleine	1.3915976285934448
the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night and for myself i assure you i could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast	3.63230037689209
holloa said he what does that mean  if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done  crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal	2.3587944507598877
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet	1.5100265741348267
it was indeed planchet and grimaud	1.0804740190505981
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter	1.4032238721847534
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms	1.5509852170944214

i landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom i found more lovely than ever	1.4483747482299805

the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me a last time my brothers servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop  but dartagnan	1.9835565090179443
are you going to drown me  these cries had something so heartrending in them that m dartagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten	2.5290825366973877
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake	3.306102991104126
oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either hercules or porthos	1.2741742134094238

he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed	1.2733875513076782
ali bring me some water  the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting	1.560680627822876
i cannot now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it  poor father murmured the priest	4.751441955566406

as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my bloodstained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte	2.100480794906616
but tell me  well what do you wish to know  will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight  seventeen replied albert	1.310251235961914

this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued	2.3458423614501953

then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	1.2818489074707031
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its transparency	1.7819056510925293
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	1.3988761901855469

monsieur dartagnan cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy monsieur dartagnan	1.347845435142517

dartagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side	1.3147889375686646

well are you going away in that manner	1.1301547288894653
and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension	1.13237464427948
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse	1.2027584314346313
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antechamber	1.177487850189209
i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to youmisfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for youi would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure  sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score	3.287240743637085
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughters hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure	1.624030590057373
at seven oclock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled	1.4918220043182373

we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy  it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona stupid one i admit but very necessaryhave you any money  something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoula young man must live respectably	3.1852338314056396
i will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example	1.204919695854187
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of dartagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost	1.5667710304260254
what do you want of me she asked in great distress	1.1648460626602173

the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	2.573673725128174
mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven	1.1615917682647705

now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking dartagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him	2.690166711807251

pretty mysterious initiated in almost all the secrets of the court which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love	2.0094473361968994
if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand	1.3138930797576904
dartagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him	2.5346643924713135
yes but i am expecting some one a friend of athos  a friend exclaimed the count	1.1976234912872314
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again	1.1888320446014404

it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey	1.1445354223251343
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going  why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion  but what are we going to do there  you know well that we go to breakfast there  but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot  because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	3.761589288711548
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his mother	1.4321720600128174
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him	1.205916166305542

porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration	1.303122639656067
on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall   oh god  he read  preserve my memory   oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for liberty but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful	2.46930193901062

well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman  and then he was called  fernand  only fernand  fernand mondego  you are sure   pardieu  i have bought enough fish of him to know his name  then why did you think of giving your daughter to him  because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me  what  oh nothing  ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego	5.001930236816406
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk	1.6435143947601318
no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness	1.3578742742538452
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dantès entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no alternative	1.4813783168792725
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired  what then is this precious stuff  did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste  of course i have  well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name	3.131155490875244
beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young mans paroxysm of grief approached him	1.2612663507461548

the other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the camp	1.2072954177856445
it was precisely at this moment that m de tréville on leaving the residence of the  lieutenantcriminel  and the governor of fort levêque without being able to find athos arrived at the palace	1.436543583869934
well thought dartagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my faultfor it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage  without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his masters audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him	2.8781895637512207
my only fear is that he will be too strong for you  my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish	1.3396315574645996
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep	1.4844467639923096
talk only by gestures or rather always listen  yes monsieur replied raoul	1.2365530729293823
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste	1.6911780834197998
franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air	1.3752893209457397
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember  yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate  in four days said morrel it is extraordinary  indeed said châteaurenaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too	3.214576244354248
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees	1.399984359741211

some of that at the bottom near the laths	1.1485843658447266
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me  then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation  yes	2.2144970893859863

he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain	1.3251688480377197
it is you your honor he said advancing toward dartagnan and i am truly pleased to meet you  dartagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre	1.5268298387527466

you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either bertuccio bowed and resumed his story	1.4077949523925781
unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied they	1.2737804651260376
here he is  dartagnan walking and soliloquizing had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel darguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him	2.864374876022339
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel	1.3072192668914795

anne   it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs	3.7247025966644287

now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said dartagnan if you persist in offering him a civility	1.400102138519287

i shall strangle you both if you dont get out said porthos at last seizing mousqueton by the throat	1.2899248600006104
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state	1.276918888092041
then dartagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting	1.2467983961105347
but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation	1.914206862449646
dartagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart	1.173352599143982

as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted	1.346011757850647

yes indeed said he i believe so  so that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew  certainly and the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion	2.3688104152679443

bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition	1.3052961826324463
yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me  that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé	3.258589744567871

for heavens sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshnessfor heavens sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch	1.5876023769378662

i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged	1.2009551525115967
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner charles began	1.3278839588165283
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simarthe gorgeous robe of officeand the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt	3.1681880950927734
if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him	1.2791681289672852

just heaven what have i read cried the duke	1.1378880739212036

oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth  these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused	1.9399768114089966
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin  how far is mazingarbe  two miles and a half  thank you  grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man	2.8931832313537598
unfold your plan my lord and we will see  take notice that you are shut upcaptured  you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource  what  that of dying together  mazarin shuddered	1.775373101234436
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment	1.8992154598236084
for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal     chapter x	1.1888848543167114
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home  be easy	1.2612581253051758
baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive  danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their hands	1.7772246599197388
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean	1.888424038887024
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m morrel	1.3038437366485596
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you  noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans heart	1.847333312034607
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton	1.1850066184997559

and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked cavalcanti	1.2266536951065063
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above	1.1447596549987793
did i tell you that i wouldnt serve any other	1.1713961362838745
the lions den  one division of la force in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined is called the court of saintbernard	1.4879488945007324

athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee	1.243097186088562
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards pèrelachaise from the faubourg sainthonoré	1.2581586837768555
one would think one was in the cave of ali baba	1.1946642398834229
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saintgermain	1.4279444217681885
trust me dont let us try to do things cheaply	1.1872707605361938
the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen	1.4935928583145142
madame de villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven oclock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve  well said villefort what then  madame de villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir  where to  to the palais  what to do  my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial  ah said villefort with a startling accent does she wish that  the servant drew back and said if you wish to go alone sir i will go and tell my mistress  villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails	4.765285491943359
so if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first  oh	1.3629170656204224
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was necessary	1.4223368167877197
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark	1.2722012996673584
i will run to monsieur de tréville to tell them all this and will meet them there  very well monsieur said planchet	1.2821180820465088
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her	1.302401065826416
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless	1.1513372659683228
yes replied m de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers	1.5404893159866333
the courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls over which the sun glances obliquely when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity	1.710842251777649
you know my opinion of my mother count look at herstill beautiful witty more charming than ever	1.2883617877960205
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir	1.287294626235962
he proposed the conditionsthe two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles	1.2379060983657837
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken	1.3661116361618042
it was aramis who broke the silence	1.0811078548431396
happen what will the devil take them they cant eat us  and he mounted his horse	1.2926274538040161

the council of the musketeers  chapter xlviii	1.1122452020645142
he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding  franz smiled for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion	2.192854642868042
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	1.3006802797317505
the worthy shipowner knew from penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him	1.4231146574020386
you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news  alas sire answered athos your majesty has guessed aright  it is bad news  yes sire  never mind the messenger is welcome	1.720131516456604
aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam	1.2034339904785156
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty	1.887477159500122
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory	2.3977365493774414
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house  valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event  what voices asked valentine	2.5830237865448
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows	1.2034040689468384
now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life  oh heavens said the young man oh heavenswhat are you saying count	1.739052653312683
la ramee i recommend monsieur le duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant  la ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper the shadow of his person but la rameegay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the dukes eyeshis incorruptibility	3.25601863861084
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack	1.4042000770568848
wrapped in this sweet idea dartagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment	1.9684593677520752
we have seen them at villeforts they proceeded then on their course	1.1709568500518799
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy  but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him  and are there no cardinals that can fight	1.5827157497406006
gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats  yes your excellency and it is true  i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat  your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome	5.42332649230957
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her apartments	1.527873158454895
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags	1.2931879758834839
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his	1.4401875734329224
at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared	1.3223450183868408
on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court	1.4400335550308228
is it not so  certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied dartagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account  what have i to fear  why that i may be dangerously woundedkilled even  impossible cried milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swordsman  you would not then prefer a method resumed dartagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless  milady looked at her lover in silence	3.5651416778564453
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am	1.4605268239974976
intact my dear friend besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine  but what is the use of harnesses without horses  i have an idea about them  athos you make me shudder  listen to me	1.7434542179107666
he rejoined this woman they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy	1.3101829290390015
my son i bless thee  the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans bed	1.2923645973205566
besidesdo you see that door athos  yes what then  well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air  i recognize you there my brave dartagnan replied athos but you are no longer our masters	1.8583595752716064
silence dherblay cried athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these	1.3055740594863892
and now when are we to go asked athos	1.1229844093322754
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand	1.9965898990631104
she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first  and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing	1.805115818977356
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence	1.5102788209915161
see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view	1.5412284135818481
the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard	1.3491897583007812
one moment said the prisoner in french	1.0927109718322754
what else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen  and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans  he went before i came down  let us go the same way we will stop at la réserve and we can drink a glass of la malgue whilst we wait for news  come along said caderousse but you pay the score  of course replied danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses	3.560181140899658
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creaturefrom the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guardsfrom that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firinglet off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms	8.083505630493164
this evening your destiny begins to change  amen exclaimed dartagnan stopping the carriage	1.246253490447998
more than that we shall have a tempest or i dont know whats what you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon luckily the captain understood his business	1.6116151809692383
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency  vaguely i was far from france at that period	1.3112385272979736
each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman	1.9730277061462402
by her step she must be young perhaps she is pretty	1.1675221920013428
a letter from charles the first	1.0852607488632202
the king came out first from his room	1.0932773351669312
we have nothing to fear from those who love us  you speak very suddenly of love monsieur said the young woman shaking her head	1.3623358011245728
now this point was settled mme	1.1179276704788208
excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience	1.944261074066162
you must set out for boulogne	1.0836031436920166
now then what do you say to that  alas	1.1135562658309937
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her	1.1447546482086182
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive	1.2477062940597534
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the wormeaten table which with the stool and the goatskin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell	1.6354414224624634
how much in that little bag  seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs  seven thousand livres cried porthos	1.3572025299072266
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small casket	1.1654008626937866
75  does your eminence command that they both be instantly arrested  it will be too late they will be gone  but still we can make sure that they are so  take ten men of my guardsmen and search the two houses thoroughly  instantly monseigneur and rochefort went hastily out of the apartment	2.297518491744995
and as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey together	1.5221697092056274
mazarin especially  yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly estimated	1.6645734310150146
the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian	1.579168438911438
what scotch  ours egad exclaimed athos	1.1273895502090454
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them	1.7151392698287964
but the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his selflove which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart	2.006334066390991
you are not a priest you are a musketeer  a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me	1.4826322793960571
tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger  lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out	1.4001010656356812
scarcely however had he touched edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house	1.41154944896698
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant	1.4814454317092896
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	1.7471072673797607
pardon me my friend  we will see about that presently said dartagnan with a slight smile	1.2270997762680054
what men call the chances of fatenamely ruin change circumstancesi have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me	1.5781619548797607
ah but what is the matter with your hand dartagnan	1.1032609939575195
it was mercédès who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him	1.282829999923706
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentines absence had done	1.2808772325515747
gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect i presume to keep me here a long time incognito  no my lord replied the gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here  then you will be besieged  we expect it  and what shall you do  defend ourselves	2.272418737411499
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	1.3970892429351807
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away	1.261690616607666
they were perhaps in league with him  oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m	1.2431279420852661
the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either farias or dantès cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain	2.9687907695770264
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy	2.1771044731140137
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event  he attributed it i believe to a political cause  i doubted from the first and now i think entirely as he does	1.577680230140686
at this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window	1.3375539779663086
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed porthos	1.216741919517517
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham	1.1706891059875488
had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of dartagnan i should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself and you would have done the same aramis  certainlybut you make me out better than i am dear count	1.8953453302383423
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over	1.2926552295684814
i own that this woman terrifies me  shall you have the courage said athos	1.199101209640503
thank god we can keep a secret  the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker	1.3133937120437622
by diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler of albania epirus and adjacent territory	1.4511100053787231
a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him	1.362403154373169
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formedit was none of these things that attracted the attentionit was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdainthese were what fixed the attention of all upon him	3.797323226928711
monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments m dessessart captain of the guards as well as the others	1.5155045986175537
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage	1.2883118391036987
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself for as you very well know boistracy is an intimate friend of mine and i cannot allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy  you make the demand badly replied aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form  the fact is hazarded dartagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis	3.870105028152466
take this pen and write  caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbé sat down and wrote  sirthe man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon	2.0955395698547363
and now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening	1.2861974239349365
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coinerssay  yes monsieur you are right said the host	1.3812412023544312
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of	1.3830980062484741
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force	1.2959333658218384
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m de saintméran and m de saintméran is dead	1.2764391899108887
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair	1.3849267959594727
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this den  set your mind at rest replied athos	1.5643048286437988
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at london  why so  because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road  is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering  one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice  ah	2.109339952468872
you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter	1.1796715259552002
the contract  three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five oclock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle eugénie danglars and andrea cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristos house and the count was preparing to go out	2.735426425933838
dartagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal	1.3632208108901978
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command  but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe  upon my honor said the prince	1.7240264415740967
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require  this manner of acting roused much respect for dartagnans policy among the musketeers	2.0219624042510986
i name only the most important  you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these  yes i speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greeki dont speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself  improve yourself repeated dantès why how can you manage to do so  why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium	5.506853103637695
the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves	1.2610405683517456

whilst porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard	1.3040658235549927
his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance	1.1819430589675903
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee  my word of honor sir said athos	1.266419768333435
sir said dartagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman	1.2068158388137817
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	1.447116494178772
dont you see them cried friquet dont you see	1.111026406288147
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her	1.3605397939682007
tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it	1.1756222248077393
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of portovecchio  dont you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands  true and he is going to land them added franz	2.24706768989563
monsieur porthos what do you say to that  i say it is easy enough answered porthos	1.200526237487793
save me  porthos and aramis arose	1.0891014337539673
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life	1.1933726072311401
happy rogue said caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed  yes said andrea	1.2787001132965088
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him  then continued châteaurenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champsélysées you only want a mistress albert smiled	1.786917805671692
good god asked the poor woman have i said anything that has wounded you  no but the name struck me because i also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well  oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends messieurs porthos and aramis  indeed	2.4400668144226074
bonacieux dartagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left halffainting upon an armchair	1.2758737802505493
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed	1.5453321933746338
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind	1.176486849784851
but my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached milady this woman is not asleep  what not asleep said felton what is she doing then  she has fainted	1.738250732421875
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy  come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m de rothschild and you have seen her  her  20183m    the beautiful greek of yesterday  no we heard i think the sound of her  guzla  but she remained perfectly invisible  when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains  where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	5.70610237121582
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities	1.180768609046936
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france	1.187497854232788
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character	1.2684180736541748
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor shipowner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources	1.4053971767425537
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy	1.2379788160324097
are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars  why do you ask me now  because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking  how said albert whose brow reddened you think m danglars  i ask you only how your engagement stands	2.104395866394043
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	1.7026879787445068
the queen entered and dartagnan remained at the door	1.0811389684677124
the shade of richelieu was mazarin	1.076930046081543
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband	1.259714126586914
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he	1.1170662641525269
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand	1.9123249053955078
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	1.1832329034805298
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you	1.1272112131118774
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfs narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion	2.1544837951660156
speak gentlemen speaki am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing	1.2592898607254028
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation	1.1493372917175293
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut  i wish we were already there said dartagnan and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses  come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go  the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the morning	2.9430103302001953
oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarins than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right	1.9795383214950562
it was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear	1.3097559213638306
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you  dartagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in miladys soul whose depths were dark and unknown	1.766497015953064
as for me it made me tremble	1.098053216934204
read the address  monsieur el comte de wardes  the remembrance of the scene at st germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon	1.4645336866378784
well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pityedmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold	2.0762360095977783
consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz dépinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever i please  what said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech	2.488128423690796
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself	1.2007930278778076
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	1.2584080696105957
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments	1.2802222967147827
because you think i am drunk	1.0769089460372925
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm  good  the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window	1.5705206394195557
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue	1.8525118827819824
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened	1.2883356809616089
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard	1.2786498069763184
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative	1.2543964385986328
athos came down last and found dartagnan already on horseback and growing impatient	1.2472755908966064
the brand of englandit would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom but the brand of franceoh by that by  that  i was branded indeed  this was too much for felton	2.065415859222412
was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery	1.296517014503479
in the name of heaven my lord cried mme	1.1085237264633179
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting  father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saintjacques  no	1.459684133529663
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiardtable which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth	2.638221025466919
upon my word you did well to come back  nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start  its the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning he sighed heavily	2.2081897258758545
you know the history of the saraband   pardieu  know it replied dartagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on	1.4523791074752808
adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him  go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan  but i have never been presented  presented to whom  to the beautiful greek  you say she is only a slave  while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess	2.302295446395874
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil	1.5588692426681519
he was a berrichon thirtyfive or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent	1.9552572965621948
he was now as we have said threeandthirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance	1.3738734722137451
after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives	2.5403661727905273
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	1.265183925628662
well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer soldi gave them away next day i find the news was false and by this false report i have lost 700000 francs  well  well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700000 francs is 175000 francs  what you say is absurd and i cannot see why m debrays name is mixed up in this affair  because if you do not possess the 175000 francs i reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and m debray is one of your friends  30245m    for shame exclaimed the baroness	5.333618640899658
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in france  yes yes i know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not  precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair  ten millions	2.762498617172241

he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another musketeer	1.4067798852920532
without doubt he recognized dartagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head	1.3819365501403809
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife  port dart 2d february  this is capital said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push on they rode forward and reached abbeville	2.280545473098755
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and sidedishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head	3.637456178665161
ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated	1.1855521202087402
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested	1.2183417081832886

the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife	1.4528354406356812
i speak as i can i restrain myself	1.1088229417800903
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented  valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed  sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult  valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins  poisondeath exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir  50071m    hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death	14.937261581420898
well what are you doing countto a former lackey	1.1596237421035767

the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends	1.4557721614837646
at first athos supported the association for a time with his own means	1.2181313037872314
monsieur dartagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep monsieur dartagnan  himself monsieur bernouin  and why have you come here  to bring news of monsieur de mazarinthe freshest news there is  what has become of him then  he is as well as you and i  nothing bad has happened to him then  absolutely nothing	2.366335153579712
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken	1.797406554222107
is he not your friend replied the baron negligently	1.1231080293655396
we are lost  in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more	1.557762861251831
no part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information	1.492953896522522
personally i do not know you  this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through	1.9018769264221191
the pistol fell from his hands	1.068507194519043
in order to make ones way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman	1.5226476192474365
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort	1.080908179283142

the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied	1.2983595132827759
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	1.7670644521713257

and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury  a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes	1.5687823295593262
but there the confidence of dartagnan stopped	1.101039171218872
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumea ball costume doubtlessbecomes her admirably  ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this	1.998872995376587

but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others  m de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree	1.5119452476501465
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide	1.4719395637512207
i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead	1.1452380418777466

if it is gods justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose  morrel shuddered	1.6574597358703613
and why  your excellency will know when you have read the letter  shall i find you here then  certainly  franz entered the hotel	1.36546790599823

the count received him with his habitual smile	1.0900564193725586
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that  you admit that you would fight then	2.8810935020446777

the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst ii have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable	7.839024543762207

the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage	2.1004343032836914
he he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung	1.1878455877304077

he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him	1.3235503435134888

on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger	1.564109206199646
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom  i have no seconds on my part monsieur said dartagnan for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends  athos reflected for an instant	3.135634422302246

oh yes certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance	1.5453810691833496
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dantès sighed heavily	1.434489369392395
for a mind so perspicuous as that of dartagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future	1.4092460870742798

cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off	1.2513386011123657
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind	1.3355947732925415
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear	1.2401760816574097

it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her	1.4834524393081665
monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me  you have then seen something replied dartagnan	1.5095034837722778

i cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars  30107m    ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough  i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable	3.7578446865081787

dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	2.104846239089966

it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the bankers as the betrothed	1.3546664714813232
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	1.4580734968185425
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrinis hotel	1.3708010911941528
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre	1.2899302244186401
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion	1.313665509223938
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission  you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come  and why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me  my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper	2.412729024887085
the lemonade  morrel was in fact very happy	1.1315629482269287
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at marseilles	1.49590003490448
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid	1.3937172889709473
dartagnan detained her by her night dress of fine india linen to implore her pardon but she with a strong movement tried to escape	1.5176571607589722
we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an understanding	1.3061625957489014
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it  i should not have believed him but men are changed by events  there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine	2.470064401626587
whom do you bring asked the young girl in romaic of monte cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy  a friend said monte cristo in the same language	1.4694422483444214
the first object that met the eyes of dartagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions	1.4207544326782227
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken  then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of feltonthe only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination	4.090306282043457
marie michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest  athos paused	1.7254159450531006
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her	1.1657427549362183
he was not long in making his toilet	1.0969125032424927
bonacieux was the very life of dartagnan	1.089896559715271
en route monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal all goes well in this direction  dartagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier	1.9072858095169067
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador	1.6172714233398438
i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me	1.9636324644088745
all the rest of the square was paved with heads	1.1606824398040771
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you here  ah this is too much cried buckingham making a step toward the door	1.3839455842971802
then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyones mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness	1.4938589334487915
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away	1.5292860269546509
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their captain  have they not heard that of their colonel	1.4497898817062378
madame cried mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and me  at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges	1.679674506187439
yes the porter  my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house  well  the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise  by whom  by thieves  you are a fool m baptistin	1.7332507371902466
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl	1.2930065393447876
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned	1.2403149604797363
alas yes said caderousse very uneasily	1.088923692703247
the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit	1.2228784561157227
well do you not adopt this means athos said dartagnan	1.1257652044296265
is this corpse come to life already	1.137143611907959
we must explain this visit which although expected by monte cristo is unexpected to our readers	1.2429203987121582
are you hungry  humiliating as such a confession is i am	1.1799471378326416
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune	1.263749361038208
then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression	1.4173763990402222
he knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard	1.3317126035690308
ha cried porthos who was not completely taken in by dartagnans gasconades	1.18109130859375
well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples	1.3466541767120361
we are about to ascertain sire replied dartagnan as he rapidly left the room	1.2246376276016235
bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that dartagnan was quite overcome	1.5159913301467896
out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away	1.5559465885162354
five hundred pistoles  that is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for me	1.300542950630188
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead  the devil cried dartagnan	1.2891310453414917
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé	1.0982177257537842
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano	1.1942875385284424
you desire to fathom this horrible secret said de winter well then so be it	1.2373217344284058
yes and now i shall be more calm  you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling	1.1743875741958618
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurators wife was obliged to give place to the king	1.615978717803955
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things  porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an adder athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrelief	1.9999784231185913
i say  there  for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there	3.025237798690796
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised	1.1761832237243652
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you	1.320208191871643
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me  no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming  and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	1.766103982925415
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	1.1982413530349731
i hoped to be able to rely upon that  and i madame said dartagnan embarrassed you promised me  take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way  dartagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme	2.1885342597961426
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and davrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to sayhe is mad  but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	3.633042335510254
dartagnan cried she is it you	1.0733617544174194
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names	1.4472613334655762
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe	1.3489651679992676
the little old man remained at the coach door the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the saddlehorses	1.3387900590896606
i think it will be wise to set off said dartagnan	1.137237787246704
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this i have the proofs  she was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force	1.7377182245254517
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him	1.213529348373413
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room	1.2066898345947266
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love valentinethat daughter of an accursed race  never had morrel witnessed such an expressionnever had so terrible an eye flashed before his facenever had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battlefield or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire	2.726684093475342
grandpapa says it is a panacea valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered	1.2372252941131592
and why have you such an air of sadness aboard  a great misfortune m morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially	1.4284290075302124
is your name bonacieux said he	1.0718367099761963
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal  yes and the queen too  the queen do you say  to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i dont know how she has regained possession  but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you  so i think replied dartagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them  yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and youto whom are you devoted now  to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devotion also  and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf  magnificent my dear fellow magnificent	10.848209381103516
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs	1.1551153659820557
scarcely had he shut her door when mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed	1.7379229068756104
this was neither long nor difficult	1.1289434432983398
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud	2.601912260055542
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friends entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to ritas father at frosinone	1.392110824584961
you give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of  and who has filled your head with all this nonsense  why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly i learned it from beauchamps journal and thirdly from my own imagination	7.729286193847656
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos	1.169240951538086
whatever may ensue i will go  if you are determined said athos do so  but the bastille said aramis	1.28278648853302
she descended and went through the passage	1.0880529880523682
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending	1.2642079591751099
does anyone dare to slander me  monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation  then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal  yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman  enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject  and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment	4.558371543884277
i have a letter to give you from the count  from the count murmured the two young people	1.1911476850509644
dartagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so	1.3162175416946411
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for	1.2026928663253784
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down	1.2221527099609375
i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody  we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness	1.6748665571212769
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy	1.11439049243927
then suddenly  how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be  it is in fact magnificent said andrea	1.4099106788635254
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees	1.330035924911499
whose is that letter of your mistress	1.0914827585220337
all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug	1.2469967603683472
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you cannot so make the best of it	1.2502152919769287
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion	1.3452990055084229
shall two members of the house be sent to yanina	1.1493221521377563
the king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing	1.329749584197998
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds	1.2224794626235962
almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith	2.1930932998657227
then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable  yes replied eugénie	1.3213883638381958
tell them this athos resumed dartagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord  athos repeated dartagnans words	1.7610633373260498
ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable	1.2339214086532593
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent	1.1321117877960205
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence	1.2559597492218018
athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired	1.2752360105514526
she had in her first marriagei dont think dartagnan i am telling you anything newmarried a lawyer they thought that nauseous you can understand thats a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men	1.740237832069397

this letter was from my brother	1.0594713687896729
exactly  he lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story  40132m    andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hares paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable illtemper	2.019355535507202
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract	1.282149076461792
good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three seals	1.2168123722076416
the youths dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day	1.5700619220733643
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friendspoor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind	1.6459805965423584
compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her	1.754926085472107
they know that i am intimate with youthat you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintancesand they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you	1.593260645866394
to saint peters first and then to the colosseum returned albert	1.180269479751587
how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her	1.329056739807129
you are right sir and no one can doubt my position  these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray	1.6361349821090698
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston  i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued	1.3066177368164062
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed	1.2582156658172607
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	1.507309079170227
dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husbands inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter  madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door	2.3551409244537354
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door	2.3293609619140625
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad  but if he does not come said dartagnan	1.431968092918396
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present	1.2736867666244507
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same	1.216866374015808
let us go you mean  no my friend said athos you must leave us  leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	1.345151662826538
then turning to the baroness may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is said he	1.180199146270752
villefort burst it open with a violent blow	1.1220369338989258
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of dartagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends	2.1621828079223633
this horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantèshe was now number 34	1.63935387134552
you are right said she i have often thought of it then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again  felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this emotion	1.838124394416809
do you think he died a natural death a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier	1.3593932390213013
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a basrelievo representing an equestrian statue	2.102505922317505
never sell it allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age and if you make a campaign with it take as much care of it as you would of an old servant	1.6532150506973267
mousqueton is propped against the door and heres the key  bravo said aramis how did you manage it  like everything else with money but it cost me dear  how much asked athos	1.6488394737243652
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake  noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	1.8746801614761353
and who told you i had no affair with a lover  it is a man then who expects you cried dartagnan	1.2831037044525146
dartagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop	1.6587069034576416
the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well  woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love  i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political  and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble  indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it	4.606943130493164
indeed you could not belong to him	1.0815505981445312
but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire	1.3788132667541504
sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as i can myself	1.5440948009490967
i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position	1.5083191394805908
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out	1.324057698249817
is it heaven that opens before me thought the dying man that angel resembles the one i have lost  monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips	1.849893569946289
the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was mad	1.181825041770935
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating  we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously	2.965772867202759
and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moments pause	1.4311997890472412
is he afraid of me or of his father	1.1173301935195923
all is over  but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king  an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss  did you not see his face asked athos	1.8558157682418823
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys visits	1.4801326990127563
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace	1.9321342706680298

athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and mannersa freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables	4.89424991607666

it is your new master my good fellow said the footman	1.1447702646255493
she ground her teeth she was of the color of ashes	1.1773524284362793
his face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	1.3547163009643555
only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france  no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one  they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning	2.4844048023223877
doctor do you hear them call for help  yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentines room  but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening	2.653380870819092
yes to a convent  and to which  i dont know the secret has been well kept  but  i  will know  and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is  i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal	1.7179322242736816
at the same time mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore	1.3798102140426636
what has happened then  sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen	1.3541369438171387
on guard  milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy	1.3597707748413086
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him	1.0933232307434082
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne	1.1734464168548584
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him	1.3683233261108398
at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old wormeaten table was a tall young man of twenty or twoandtwenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled	1.9442670345306396
the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected	1.4779573678970337
the same evening some friends of mine visited mem	1.166275143623352
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances	1.305951476097107
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten  no said maximilian you shall not leave him	1.5503044128417969
while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could  30059m    dear valentine  well would you believe it	6.948785781860352
at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep	1.6466301679611206
and we say proud as a gascon replied dartagnan	1.134411334991455
it is he who has raised all this revolt  the more reason said mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down  and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal  the queen sprang to the window	2.533823013305664
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done	1.3866482973098755
where do you wish to be taken asked the presidentanywhere out of your presence replied m dépinay	1.222759485244751
i point one of the poniards at la ramees breast and i say to him my friend i am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art a dead man  the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words	2.074398994445801
the life of the four young men had become fraternal	1.1319557428359985
this time without knowing why dartagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins	1.2665314674377441
the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death	1.2827813625335693
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground	1.6303584575653076
the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested  what	1.1827629804611206
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice  do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience  at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured	2.8693490028381348
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle	1.2134406566619873
afraid of making any inquiries at this house dartagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras	1.4161369800567627
ten minutes afterward she was at home	1.0907039642333984
are you going added she to comminges	1.1331957578659058
dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities	1.9829461574554443
a step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon	1.3116390705108643
as to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its disappearance	1.2313677072525024
i shall retire and die tranquillyat home  for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron  you shall be one  and have you not seen any of our other friends  yes i have seen aramis  and what does he wish	1.7412382364273071
ah im ready to do what you will cried porthos even to swear by mahomet	1.2637124061584473
i saw him yesterday your friends lackey was leading him do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles yes	1.3078755140304565
staystayhow strange that it should not have occurred to me before	1.1589044332504272
oh  and more especially a notorious coward  oh oh	1.148288369178772
mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he said bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers who astonished at this apparition stopped fifty paces from the bastion gentlemen a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion	2.187782049179077
dartagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in english come being with the classic english oath the only english words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck	2.001786947250366
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him	1.1512078046798706
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy	1.3165791034698486
not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of france  dartagnan breathed again	1.365047574043274
she belonged to one of the first families in italy i think did she not  she was of a noble family of fiesole count  and her name was  do you desire to know her name  oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it  the count knows everything said the italian bowing	2.322376012802124
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king  ah you knew that said mordaunt	1.2813918590545654
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone  tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness	1.4727047681808472
in what  in a pate for example  in a pate said la ramee	1.2575558423995972
you remain in london said porthos	1.0759550333023071
at length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountainside	1.2435513734817505
will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me  thanks count no replied de winter	1.3028347492218018
what do you say to this project  the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever wasfalse and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said  do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king	2.616894245147705
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own apartment	1.3802951574325562
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice	1.1950385570526123
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabinboy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our direction	1.9828630685806274
i trust all this will soon be taken away  bertuccio bowed	1.1762667894363403
nanenino  yes yes yes said the old mans eye	1.0911811590194702
i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure	1.2192195653915405
i say sire that there is now but one way open	1.1723709106445312
dartagnan therefore returned to the rue férou	1.0719952583312988
he turned round it was danglars	1.071919560432434
oh cried porthos as if in pain	1.0893172025680542
have the fugitives been pursued  yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted  how many are there  four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded  four said dartagnan looking at porthos	1.7555996179580688
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fère the pleasure or the  ennui  he may experience	1.6935497522354126
the name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey	1.479739785194397
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament	1.6641391515731812
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man	1.2063820362091064
they are aimingthey are going to fire  they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palais royal exclaimed mazarin	1.397387981414795
inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saintméran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two	1.719835638999939
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted	1.115810751914978
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter  and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time	1.4432529211044312
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition  and villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant whom his son had not called	1.5823631286621094
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum	2.4394025802612305
milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the counts that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes	1.6340357065200806
you will have to find the abbé busoni and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare	1.3262946605682373
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world  with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsieur de richelieu allpowerful	2.016040325164795
at the door of the chapel dartagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for athos but athos had disappeared	1.3234505653381348
impossible  they appear to be numerous  then tis something else  another horse said porthos	1.2394464015960693
in the first place i have never succeeded by that means	1.1345192193984985
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul	1.8680473566055298
but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frédérick24 exclaimed  fool  then enclosing monte cristos receipt in a little pocketbook he addedyes come at twelve oclock i shall then be far away  then he doublelocked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in banknotes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed  to madame la baronne danglars  i will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured	5.545311450958252
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white	1.2319576740264893
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is	1.4905462265014648
after charles i cromwell after cromwell charles ii and then james ii and then some soninlaw or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king	1.6578761339187622
come come calm yourself my sweet girl	1.132038950920105
nobut perhaps you will permit me to call to mindstay  the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts	1.292145013809204
the next day m noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	1.6792259216308594
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and i fainted again  and now how are you feeling  very ill replied the wounded man	1.6584763526916504
the anjou wine   after the most disheartening news of the kings health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward	2.074636459350586
there are many stories related of him and among them this	1.1821986436843872
in ten minutes it would strike seven	1.129103422164917
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell  but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust asked athos	1.5123831033706665
everyone hastened to purchase  moccoletti franz and albert among the rest	1.1983860731124878
besides germain was in the interests of the queen and if anything should happen mme	1.2417452335357666
15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor  but cried morrel this purse is not yours julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning	1.6423633098602295
it is certainly the king said the man rising again	1.1094287633895874
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another	1.6185301542282104
it is told that the duc dantin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis xiv	1.3873045444488525
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention	1.7435134649276733
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand	1.3189477920532227
for heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me	1.271148681640625
if you would but accept my offers	1.104775071144104
bonacieuxhe ran full of joy to seek his comrades whom he had left only half an hour before but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied	1.4840339422225952
run to torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the bearer	1.3110778331756592
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	1.8334193229675293
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been	1.2750922441482544
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the dukes health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified  whenever my lord pleases  the prince looked at grimaud grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarterpast six	2.458799123764038
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos	1.3288242816925049
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing	1.3649054765701294
whats that asked porthos what are they firing at now	1.1903424263000488
where is athos  in the cellar monsieur  what you scoundrel	1.1477851867675781
so that monsieur watched bassompierre the king the duc dangoulême and the cardinal m de schomberg	1.2293879985809326
you are in a hurry said the musketeer as pale as a sheet	1.1602271795272827
i have not failed to do so your reverences replied the young man returning their salutation	1.214983582496643
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account  you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man	1.6822131872177124
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion	1.7260380983352661
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily	1.484266996383667
are we not their majesties servants  at that moment porthos entered	1.202891230583191
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century  chapter xi	1.161861538887024
but in this world we must risk something	1.1134562492370605
do you think then that any harm can have happened to him asked aramis	1.1963096857070923
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur darminges and beat a retreat	1.3450876474380493
and you  i am lord de winter baron sheffield  well then i am your servant monsieur baron said dartagnan though you have names rather difficult to recollect and touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to paris	1.7658970355987549
you are right sir said raoul	1.0567057132720947
50279m    an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel	1.3588895797729492
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heartthree of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning	2.551849603652954
that you may be sure said the gascon means something  they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it	1.7145016193389893
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes	1.4051645994186401
it looks as if you were trying to fleece me  i	1.1688835620880127
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england	1.1671512126922607
yes monseigneur said porthos it is he  monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept	1.346129298210144
firstly i wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time	1.3587223291397095
are the oars in the boat  everything is ready  tis well  mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match	1.9711294174194336
come here fellow  bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them	2.043875217437744
dartagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a comrade	1.5295015573501587
i am as poor as job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes i dont believe you would find a hundred pistoles  peste	1.452617883682251
youve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven	1.1523693799972534
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune i do not think that m dépinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss	1.500016450881958
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos	1.1423321962356567
the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentines  i am coming  was the customary signal of farewell	1.577803611755371
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated them	1.3160536289215088
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming	1.1440143585205078
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of aramis  monsieur dartagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale	1.6512784957885742
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement  i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so  then make yourself quite easy	1.6346232891082764
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched	1.8169546127319336
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style  i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasnt his mothers energy  what my good fellow replied athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are	2.5807247161865234
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert	1.51094388961792
only i warn you that when i reside in a country i conform to all its code and i have no wish to put myself within the compass of the french laws for your sake  oh do not do that excellency i have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in despair	2.1684470176696777
see planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like you  ah monsieur said planchet i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak  it was decided that planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by heart	3.7709147930145264
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them	1.9516892433166504
no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you  why that question my dear host asked dartagnan	1.3793580532073975
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy	1.1552469730377197
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man	1.1834012269973755
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	1.2244396209716797

it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever	1.6018321514129639
no how would you have me know  parry bent his head and whispered to the king it is the comte de la fere and his friends  raising my scaffold cried the king astounded	1.5168523788452148
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin	1.1034022569656372
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me  a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	2.4500396251678467

eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening	1.2324926853179932
why then have you laid it aside  because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners  sir replied dartagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks	2.311008930206299

madame de villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say  oh that naughty child	4.399874687194824
you have a sad air  alas said dartagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate  tell me  presently said dartagnan	1.2856881618499756

in an hour inquired danglars turning pale	1.1022664308547974
sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure	4.169010162353516

he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman	1.4945210218429565
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one	1.3915143013000488

i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us	1.2287790775299072
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together	1.6745020151138306
or rather at what he said  and what was he saying  he said this madame mazarin is a stumblingblock	1.27641761302948
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	1.113943099975586

franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a restingplace and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many  ignes fatui	4.426959037780762
i embrace you with all my heart	1.0992718935012817

like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day	2.0967490673065186

andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings attorney	1.8221913576126099
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind	2.287168264389038

dartagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m de tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens	1.4325439929962158
those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime	1.782201886177063
then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought	1.2275298833847046
be on the qui vive cried dartagnan	1.1257647275924683
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all	1.5184710025787354
stop my friend i have an idea  speak monsieur  in your place i would do one thing  what  while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions	2.1660401821136475
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio	1.1449956893920898
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance	1.2803081274032593
then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied	1.524735689163208
i shall find many men as able as you are  i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort	1.2543898820877075

but you first came to breakfast did you not	1.134003758430481

and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him	1.2184805870056152
that is your road excellency and now you cannot again mistake  and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money	1.5950766801834106

we must understand each other said the duke	1.0708156824111938
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself	1.7890058755874634
now then let us breakfast  with what an air he says all this muttered beauchamp decidedly he is a great man  a great man in his own country added debray	1.552220106124878

ah i remember athos is at monsieur de trévilles  but where are you going monsieur where are you going  i am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried dartagnan	1.5087506771087646
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar	1.232046365737915
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him	1.2643564939498901
four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered	1.306079387664795
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket	1.2895355224609375
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution  thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution  yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	2.9645121097564697
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth	1.5854451656341553
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world	1.5348238945007324

so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it  the cardinal repressed a smile	1.6198959350585938
but its of no importance continued dartagnan with natural assurance its of no importance	1.2859041690826416
by no means it really seems to me very curious  yes indeed	1.2051712274551392
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes	1.1658129692077637
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated  deaddead  50090m      chapter 103	1.4155158996582031
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons	1.993965983390808
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifes room nothing is changed here  he then closed the door of the landing	1.4008080959320068
it rests between his conscience and his god  but if your honor knew this man  i neither know nor wish to know him	1.4211469888687134
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as dartagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but dartagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line	1.864857792854309
it is you who are not a woman muttered mazarin	1.107348918914795
at daybreak dartagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done	1.1780000925064087
she still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love	1.5958435535430908
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said	1.2075684070587158
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood	1.3108408451080322
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance	1.3101224899291992
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said dartagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope  ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought  what monsieur cried dartagnan and do you suppose  i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason	5.426031112670898
the neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was over	2.138824462890625
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	1.6438432931900024
but what has become of m dépinay replied morrel	1.1112804412841797
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied	1.175701379776001
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias	1.6153666973114014
yes the rolling of a carriage  it is the one my brother sends for us  oh my god  come come	1.3491452932357788

where are you come from sir	1.0772042274475098
on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room	1.2688307762145996
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him	1.3697127103805542
at precisely six oclock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah	1.5001986026763916
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence  how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine	1.900335669517517
valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event	1.753003716468811
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	1.1501680612564087

ask baron franz dépinay i think he tasted them one day  yes replied morcerf he said something about it to me  but said beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you  always  would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage	2.7195162773132324
oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friends	1.1701910495758057
the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of  lucia di lammermoor  supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy	1.8727970123291016
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word	1.4031420946121216
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep	1.3983254432678223

i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving men	1.1953989267349243
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	2.3742475509643555
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers	1.5280146598815918

if i should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance  meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and windows	1.568718671798706
thank you said luigi drawing back his hand i render a service i do not sell it  well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift  ah yes that is another thing  then said the traveller take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings  and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between albano and civitacastellana  i accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins  for a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre  what is your name inquired the traveller	9.836877822875977
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps	2.5659282207489014

in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path	1.2613582611083984
but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the counts blue coat	1.504793643951416
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe	1.2717347145080566
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pockethandkerchief to his guest in token of adieu	1.29493248462677

i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated  oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed	1.5645933151245117
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	1.914595603942871
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the illjoined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars	2.3716981410980225

meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours	1.5040385723114014

how much do i owe this gracious prince	1.1549773216247559
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oclock	1.8332884311676025

mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch	1.3658658266067505

andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand	1.775758147239685
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians  my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 4000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24000 livres of our moneya sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country  talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy	25.144012451171875

porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	1.116828441619873
alas sir said he i cannot but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you  i certainly am surprised replied m de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese  i had one sir and thank god such as i could wish cried dartagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from me  he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m de tréville	4.518110275268555
i cannot speak latin responded the marquise	1.1335893869400024
for i am sure the count is his father	1.092139482498169
sit down morrel and wait  morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven	2.755331516265869
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human	1.1538432836532593
i took one of them by the throat and threequarters throttled him	1.1661155223846436
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg	1.4720734357833862
you will go to marseilles said dantèsfor you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them	1.274006962776184
he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal	1.0917164087295532
the room was neatly comfortably furnished	1.1318308115005493
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman  chatillon and flamarens started	2.0097620487213135
remember that  olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	1.1837047338485718
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip	1.6163219213485718
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	1.8875194787979126
fernands mind was made up he would shoot dantès and then kill himself	1.233986496925354
the treasure of the spadas exists	1.0701897144317627
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoledyou the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power  danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously	2.775480031967163
in his youth dartagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word	1.7997910976409912
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	1.6780357360839844
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarrons pension  that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	1.4190882444381714
well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him  yes your excellency andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed	1.358203411102295
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest	1.5474361181259155
as i look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio	1.5522159337997437
you will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak  i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself it is more time than i require	1.440359115600586
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	1.8987330198287964
the cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future	1.3029050827026367
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key	1.377996802330017
the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement	1.4818909168243408
limited right of replacement or refund  if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from	2.1470179557800293
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees  monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian	1.7293328046798706
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	1.1369659900665283
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers	1.5494334697723389
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours	1.1756657361984253
but as we have said dartagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty	1.2333836555480957
you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband have you  explain yourself my lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though i hear your words i declare i do not understand them  then you have no religion at all i like that best replied lord de winter laughing	2.0861964225769043
these bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus  monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo	1.514924168586731
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar	1.4626370668411255
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour	1.2205274105072021
no my child no said madame de saintméran but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father  my father inquired valentine uneasily	1.4376578330993652
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said dartagnan upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us  he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachmans little finger	1.8773174285888672
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtiers expression than by valentines indisposition	1.3163107633590698
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me  the executioner of lille the executioner of lille cried milady a prey to insensate terror and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling	1.9303181171417236
certainly said andrea i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop	1.3135522603988647
i often think of that young man dartagnan  strange	1.141984462738037
the same evening the following was read in  le messager   by telegraph	1.214059829711914
i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things  and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de retzs appearance	1.9558262825012207
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do	1.1552996635437012
i believe so i dont know its of no consequence	1.1483932733535767
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur  it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release broussel from prison and give him back to the people  oh cried anne to humble myself thus	2.657031774520874
the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria	1.722198247909546
when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze	1.4164104461669922
monsieur du tremblay received dartagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake	1.4292272329330444
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as dartagnan says will carry the letter  well said cried aramis you dont often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st john of the golden mouth	2.3655295372009277
edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand	1.358027696609497
yes  shall i call him  yes  valentine went to the door and called barrois	1.201647400856018
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of ityouyes ifaith youre rightthose delicate yet firmset lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart	1.7981669902801514
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by dartagnan  all for one one for all  thats well	1.6685643196105957
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything  because she was in fear of being arrested  why has she not written to me then  because she was afraid of compromising you  dartagnan you restore me to life cried aramis	1.8326963186264038
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	1.4203518629074097
then said dartagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to do  yes said athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen  athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman	1.8854401111602783
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton  ah sir	1.3546501398086548
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged	1.762643575668335
you must accomplish loyally the commission with which i deign to charge you and on that condition i pardon everything i forget everything and what is more and she held out her hand to him i restore my love  bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his wife	2.111006736755371
the treasure  when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found faria seated and looking composed	1.3961758613586426
and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply  de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply	1.5004944801330566
villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage	1.3274906873703003
i must have time to file through these bars	1.1435086727142334
yes a thousand times yes  and who completed it as it now is  i did	1.22672700881958
the room of the retired baker chapter 82	1.1392673254013062
a table ready set out awaited them	1.127356767654419
well i went to a horse dealers where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named médéah	1.2558172941207886
the moment you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french law  i know it sir replied monte cristo but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves	2.60687255859375
come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for i am here and will watch over you  morrel shook his head sorrowfully	1.6764723062515259
it was written and signed by albert	1.092206597328186
albert ran to fetch a carriage	1.0784893035888672
oh hear me to the end	1.0648282766342163
and you want my blessing he said	1.0860698223114014
go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me  bernouin bowed and retired	1.5061469078063965
she remembered that she had a son said he and i forgot i had a daughter then shaking his head sorrowfully poor haydée said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something	1.6774699687957764
m dépinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement   no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history	3.8477413654327393
dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in midair	1.3389033079147339
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers	1.3636223077774048
that however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as i am to that of your majesty  i ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you  the cardinal smiled	1.8384959697723389
this account confirmed that of the mayor	1.1199102401733398
you remember what a beautiful night it was	1.1047134399414062
this last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with papers	1.227944016456604
the journey  monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together	1.218936562538147
it is your brother who sends this carriage  exactly but that is not all	1.1943172216415405
have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart  yes replied mme	1.3192325830459595
villefort ran upstairs without saying a word	1.1195143461227417
it is a little worse for the journey but thats no matter  there are no horses  albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand	1.529414176940918
peppino put out the torch peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall	1.9553505182266235
a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat	1.3375394344329834
and here he comes by jupiter	1.107399582862854
first and foremost dear dartagnan we have no title such as count here	1.260362982749939
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a loud voice this verse in jeremiah  god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom i have sent unto you  the four friends exchanged glances	2.0943210124969482
then he said to himself  i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody	1.2878726720809937
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty	1.4769936800003052
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent	1.1293623447418213
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told  raoul bowed	1.3726316690444946
these rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the comte de la fere	1.2892335653305054
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed  ah if there were no sentinel  there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations	2.4102182388305664
bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great	1.3415759801864624
by that plain arrangement of the hair by that costume of extreme simplicity by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable she recognized one of those gloomy puritans she had so often met not only in the court of king james but in that of the king of france where in spite of the remembrance of the st bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge	2.9001691341400146
every soldier must be ambitious must he not	1.17226243019104
the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise	1.347137689590454
these men are going to behead your father	1.1055951118469238
for to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all  what brother cried milady must i name him again	1.443077564239502
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair	1.1345497369766235
open the door  the captain obeyed	1.091346263885498
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land	1.4232118129730225
i once knew a bragelonneis he still alive  no sir he is dead and i believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which i take my name  and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name  the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing	2.674041748046875
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme	1.5784591436386108
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquietfor behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future	1.6733348369598389
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around  i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground	2.793747901916504
m bonacieux was at his door	1.0542889833450317
here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will	2.159428119659424
if we had been five murmured athos thinking of dartagnan and porthos	1.1586958169937134
but what has happened then since last evening count  the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi i have seen a ghost  and that ghost  told me morrel that i had lived long enough  maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other	2.056049346923828
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay  your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	1.3555835485458374
where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom	1.3462196588516235

the countess took albert to meet madame danglars	1.0925467014312744
villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head	1.2558283805847168
towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached	1.848930835723877
there is no knighterrant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady i detain a prisoner but i have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide a bigamist into the bed of lord de winter my brother	2.1263341903686523
the expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said  you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars  a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation	3.056917190551758
arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of ré with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the comte de toiras who commanded for the king in the isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing	1.9109126329421997

the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel	1.171265721321106
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung  bravo villefort cried the marquis excellently well said	2.95774507522583

he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole	1.3476612567901611
come and i will explain to you  and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went	1.4299461841583252
you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw  dear child said mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye	1.6114667654037476
ha answered porthos behold other players appear  and in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the road	1.675331473350525
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle  very well said dartagnan his eyes aflame battle	1.3228952884674072
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived	1.2633997201919556
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded	1.0903979539871216
i say nothing about blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses	1.1914646625518799
stay said monte cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees well my man digging found a box or rather the ironwork of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant  30225m    monte cristo felt the arm of madame danglars stiffen while that of villefort trembled	3.244218349456787
madame de boistracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid	1.3197764158248901
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself	1.5180470943450928
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me  come now said athos you are joking  in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said  i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements  no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences  poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal  come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair  perhaps you speak the truth aramis  well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with dartagnan porthos and possibly even raoul	20.759809494018555
milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward	1.5647048950195312
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery	1.9764072895050049
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart	1.2478878498077393
the departure for belgium chapter 98	1.1328271627426147
ah sir answered raoul you joke about a real misfortune that is cruel indeed  the good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the mornings skirmish	1.60702383518219
well said dartagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death  athos shook his head	1.2656140327453613
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench	1.3611936569213867
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château dif that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villeforts promise	2.3441622257232666
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier	1.288750171661377
the old father and mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others arms	1.8481249809265137
the young man pressed valentines hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase	1.2582013607025146
an instant after they were on the deck	1.1008667945861816
madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them	1.9298146963119507
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage	1.3580126762390137
and you monsieur du vallon  yes you sir	1.0788116455078125
well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals	1.5704387426376343
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to dartagnans chair	1.3467497825622559
gentlemen replied dartagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence	1.2373950481414795
give me therefore one more day before i invite you i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality  if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate it will not be a house i shall see but a palace	1.8336950540542603
dartagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position	1.1941038370132446
a mantlepiece with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each sideone representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius begginga grayish paper red and black tapestrysuch was the appearance of lord wilmores drawingroom	2.2813632488250732
ah  bonacieux inferred from this ah that the affair grew more and more intricate	1.2809382677078247
still he had not even uttered a sigh	1.0997310876846313
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve	1.7544811964035034
why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me	1.1321401596069336
oh i will be a match for you murmured milady between her teeth be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monks frock  by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not milady let this check take away your appetite	2.6316888332366943
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated	1.622683048248291
and to sign the contract in three days  yes  then in my turn i also say very well  danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	1.4465432167053223
well madame said mazarin bowing i desire that you give me a share in your friends as i have shared with you the little industry and talent that heaven has given me	1.5320924520492554
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear	1.336908221244812
to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains walls hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream	2.603957176208496
with what ideas does that letter inspire you  oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that m danglars has left suspiciously  certainly but is this all you have to say to me  i do not understand you said debray with freezing coldness	2.00689435005188
noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	1.1514700651168823
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercédès seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly	2.2720913887023926
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion  and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to	2.8817226886749268
they can move their arms they can and that is much	1.148208498954773
we will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the affair of yesterday and the two will pass off together  m de tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of st germain	2.332136869430542
no one can say that m noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps  yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed	1.4368926286697388
we have had a narrow escape  but said valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son	1.3438116312026978
his gravity made him look older than he was  well then if we can get athos all will be well	1.38700270652771
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry	1.500243067741394
0059m    when one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him	1.653668761253357
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at dartagnan hatefully	1.0944018363952637
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a military cut	1.2745773792266846
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier	1.5151987075805664
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough  i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a breton which promises something  yes yes resumed de guiche i am sure he can fire a musket when required	2.1194913387298584
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition	1.4194329977035522
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow	1.338375449180603
have you lost it asked blaisois	1.0924248695373535
those barrels i saw through the door  port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum	1.3193484544754028
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage	1.191427230834961
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber	1.7518266439437866
de winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed all	1.188261866569519
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast	4.4607415199279785
dartagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron	1.3468412160873413
danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows	1.1471507549285889
my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me	1.4410371780395508
i come for your commands my lord he said	1.095888376235962
in the corridor he met mme	1.0894601345062256
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises  a peculiar smile passed over dantès lips he squeezed jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain alone	2.361894369125366
but i tell you that i am the mistress of the house gentlemen	1.130692481994629
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues	1.6022751331329346
it was then three oclock in the morning	1.0848153829574585
i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him  oh no our breakfast comes from my fathers kitchen	1.3431057929992676
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo  he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti	2.049110174179077
he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will i hope be grateful for it porthos do not lose sight of his eminence  aramis then joined athos and dartagnan who were consulting together	1.7024223804473877
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this  so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace	1.9355281591415405
one was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden petals	1.7522691488265991
aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins	1.524378776550293
a man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward	1.4266403913497925
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her	1.0987143516540527
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with	1.2333667278289795
confound it cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	1.2837824821472168
planchet had no need to learn more	1.120597004890442
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass	1.43703293800354
i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king  yes madame but on the frontier he was met by lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings	1.6810235977172852
in the meantime dartagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette	1.2383806705474854
at least you dont speak well of him  that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim  but this letter in which he recommends you to me  is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites  but why have you not fled  whither should i go	2.5524420738220215
although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a steppingstone	1.8278213739395142
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the  parade  he had already three inches of steel in his breast	1.6768232583999634
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	1.3100682497024536
his majesty has so good a heart that he cannot understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason	1.3518540859222412
patience said athos i had a plan	1.0876113176345825
i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me	1.2762428522109985
one night more and he would be on his way	1.1112300157546997
in truth i was fated said she	1.112454891204834
of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile	1.2110999822616577
they stopped him at the door	1.0419470071792603
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground	1.7387242317199707
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room	1.1634962558746338
three days passedseventytwo long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes	1.254811406135559
well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal	1.162887692451477
it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la fere  what	1.3280208110809326
this wine will give you strength drink and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically	1.3371033668518066
his costume of guardsman in the company of m dessessart ought to be his passport	1.2690749168395996
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin  the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	2.371492624282837
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friends fat back now sir allow me to leave you for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you  this dear friend said dartagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me  forgottenhe cried mousqueton theres not a day sir that we dont expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion or of monsieur de bassompierre  on dartagnans lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soulthe last trace of youth and happiness that had survived lifes disillusions	9.814642906188965
as a proof remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night  that was the very evening when the abduction of mme	1.801706314086914
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind	1.1997361183166504
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows	1.1103938817977905
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to sayvalentine has been assassinated  villefort hung his head davrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes	1.957966685295105
as for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no other	1.2340878248214722
monsieur dartagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns	1.3019579648971558
my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculousstupid	1.0752806663513184
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly	1.2279107570648193
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos	1.2587529420852661
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	1.371555209159851
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english	1.179932713508606
the curates asked him what was to be done	1.1205989122390747
oh oh said dartagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer	1.1704277992248535
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days  to get married  yes first and then to go to paris  very good have what time you require dantès	1.6687735319137573
oh yes and with all my heart for i know what it is to be in love  you know what it is to be in love said dartagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention	1.5019108057022095
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe	1.2909537553787231
are you an angel and the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before monte cristo with indescribable terror	1.372573971748352
with your belt my lord replied la ramee	1.1096748113632202
well beautiful lady very well said he but  pardieu  if you dont calm yourself i will design a second  fleurdelis  upon one of those pretty cheeks  scoundrel infamous scoundrel howled milady	1.6544784307479858
the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment	1.2505161762237549
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment	1.288487434387207
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it	1.423461675643921
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude	3.1238386631011963
we have fallen in with a party of spaniards	1.1141419410705566
in the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything	1.3671573400497437
and monsieur de nogaret de la valette what do you say of him	1.183007836341858
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner  oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall  and why parry  do not look i implore you my king  but what is the matter	2.2069144248962402
i wish to say three words to you monsieur chevalier stammered the  soubrette	1.1965835094451904
there edmond dantès he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged  monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentines room of which he doublelocked the door	3.5115370750427246
the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms	1.4020715951919556
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck	1.3342088460922241
hunting for the equipments   the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly dartagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos	3.265258312225342
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them	1.2741219997406006
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan	1.3567121028900146
save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands	1.13874351978302
to meet dartagnan with a false excuse	1.0978081226348877
you have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely	1.2290589809417725
and you say that monsieur dartagnan was one of those four men  he led the enterprise  and who were the others  i leave it to monsieur dartagnan to name them my lord	1.4854546785354614
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime  remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so	2.0346853733062744
it is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this happiness  comminges bowed and left	1.3580328226089478
it is kept by a friend of ours  at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the peacock  yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost brokenwinded  aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	3.085106611251831
she had fled with him from her convent  with your brother  yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death	1.3535997867584229
i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted  haydées arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands	1.8346853256225586
one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared	1.42351496219635
as dartagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse	1.8469816446304321

go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage	1.1875700950622559

and cannot women be dishonored by appearances	1.148709774017334
delirium he repeated delirium do you say	1.147825002670288

noirtier wishes to speak  yes indicated noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance	1.39938485622406
dartagnan thought this was the moment to interfere	1.1222748756408691
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity	1.608996033668518

again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused	1.7273578643798828

dartagnan entered after the cardinal and behind dartagnan the door was guarded	1.1568222045898438
in fact four men such as they werefour men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single pointmust inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem	5.060582637786865

count she said bragelonne must be a charming place	1.1138994693756104
each was anxious to gain admission before the other	1.1549713611602783
wait  and regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on	1.3440864086151123
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friends chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself againthat is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men	2.1830291748046875
yes you see i am as exact as you are	1.123570203781128
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	1.5283875465393066
i am determined to tell them all about it  be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety	1.5255646705627441
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals	2.1903598308563232
now you are rich said monte cristo	1.0684508085250854

you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	2.0004630088806152
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	1.6901419162750244
he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii	1.1165001392364502

the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m noirtier and the elder dépinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife	2.0509421825408936
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed	1.1674127578735352
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the gravedigger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard	1.5534050464630127

one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance	1.302248477935791
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance	1.3681645393371582
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefortobserve that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefortvillefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the soninlaw of the marquis and marquise de saintméran	3.4355225563049316
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid	2.060110569000244
will you eat any of these beans cousin porthos said mme	1.2131893634796143

they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate	1.3197662830352783
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house	1.1199387311935425
dartagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively	1.3161559104919434
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms  and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice	2.0683887004852295
whom  the man we are seeking  it seems said dartagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries  come replied the same lofty tone answer	1.803256630897522
yes we will fly i will confess all to heri will tell her daily that i also have committed a crimeoh what an alliancethe tiger and the serpent worthy wife of such as i am	1.735048770904541
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his name	1.1804718971252441
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words  oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature	1.4207011461257935
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time	1.3235481977462769
madame more hopeless than he thinks	1.1181355714797974
threequarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him	1.1725434064865112
positively these four men must be on my side  the same evening the cardinal spoke to m de tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp	1.5112031698226929
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew milady perfectly	1.3182671070098877
you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother	1.2002553939819336
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart	1.3025530576705933
dartagnan looked at the two women one after the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made a mistake in their formation	1.49000084400177
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankers family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars	1.7966452836990356
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room	1.6241412162780762
as you will replied the duke	1.0548697710037231
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics	1.9482102394104004
approach gentlemen said albert i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you  proceed sir said the count	1.9017722606658936
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	1.4573819637298584
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the  concierges  door and which merits a particular description	1.8849537372589111
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak	1.293971300125122
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father	1.3959953784942627
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you	1.107116460800171
from him whom you have rendered the happiest of men   comte de wardes   this note was in the first place a forgery it was likewise an indelicacy	1.4629552364349365
time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner	1.6117057800292969
she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the place royale by the duc de guise	1.6491886377334595
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or faceit is not your fault	1.794100284576416
the door of the backstaircase opened then the sidegate of the garden and ali and his master were on the spot with lights	1.2866753339767456
i left five hundred with assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred i set off for nîmes	1.3106439113616943
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniardstwenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet	2.913170337677002
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes	2.900827646255493
well what shall you do with this money count	1.1224778890609741
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind  felton has not told him said milady to herself	1.5570964813232422
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to aramis and the third to porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance	1.6545133590698242
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted  everything depends on you  explain yourself pray  monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba	2.933581590652466
who will support them  a shudder ran through the young mans frame	1.183514952659607
as night closed in they arrived at thirsk	1.12810480594635
let me see your plan i dare say it is a pretty one  why not	1.2325893640518188
the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to flight	1.2539738416671753
rather place faith in what i tell you	1.1334530115127563
what is this that m de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune  incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	1.4647836685180664
eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of monte cristo  the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly	1.3695683479309082
how did this happen said morrel	1.0864206552505493
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	1.5883554220199585
for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow	1.4903926849365234
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop	1.8640437126159668
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word	1.1475529670715332
bad monsieur bad replied the king i am bored  this was in fact the worst complaint of louis xiii who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say monsieur soandso let us weary ourselves together  how	1.916469931602478
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile	1.423458456993103
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison  ah monsieur de rochefort	1.5294893980026245
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him	1.1860907077789307
listen then  ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them  listen continued the abbé	1.4783045053482056
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards theres no use in thinking any more about athos	1.60403311252594
dartagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung	1.342678427696228
de saintméran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied	1.3366624116897583
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement	1.3273825645446777
i told him very humblyfor i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majestys musketeersi told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions	1.653714895248413
but continued she lord wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not  oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for	1.7792832851409912
you have taken your revenge for the rue férou and even exceeded it you ought to be satisfied  if your majesty is so said tréville we are  oh yes i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of dartagnan	1.858568787574768
have you monsieur le gascon asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands	1.280287742614746
and why asked the old man	1.0661187171936035
sir said davrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentines maid if you please  villefort went himself to find her and davrigny approached noirtier	1.394188642501831
yours is a pretty business  but said the agitated mercer do me the pleasure monsieur to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison  because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between youof an infernal plan  i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done and that if she has committed any follies i renounce her i abjure her i curse her  bah said athos to the commissary if you have no more need of me send me somewhere	6.388928413391113
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear	1.3672682046890259
but i thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one  i	1.2534035444259644
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other	1.1645910739898682
we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears	1.51627516746521
at the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold	1.1201342344284058
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea	1.596603512763977
go he said go my child edward ran out	1.1494883298873901
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house	1.7748281955718994
i have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of dartagnanwho by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon  but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him  no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	6.678681373596191
do you wish to speak to us asked morrel	1.0915751457214355
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room	1.3320940732955933
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview	1.2705473899841309
the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen	1.660399079322815
danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage	1.1941039562225342
madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before	1.3310019969940186
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies	1.344810128211975
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve	2.3998868465423584
he is in a hurry  40190m    these words restored albert he darted from the room followed by the count	1.2621073722839355
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do they opened the door and the four men alighted  franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fathers death which had hitherto been a mystery	2.5296413898468018
you must not stop an instant on the way	1.092005729675293
be satisfied said dartagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard  oh monsieur procurators wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier  and did you convey this answer to your guest  we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission  so that he still expects his money  oh lord yes monsieur	4.7479705810546875
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion  and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment	1.3417770862579346
at the rue guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay	1.2147362232208252
coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good housewife	1.2574081420898438
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars  i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort	1.6822185516357422
and what a strange air for a victor  but you answered porthos seem to me agitated  theres a reason	1.3544385433197021
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat  aramis rushed after the fugitive hat	1.3382480144500732
he should have been  nothing said the king nothing	1.0827453136444092
what do you see  a troop  of how many persons  twenty men  what sort of men  sixteen pioneers four soldiers  how far distant  five hundred paces  good	1.590819239616394
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of everblooming shrubs everripe fruit and everlovely virgins	1.9521100521087646
why when a man has friends they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily  fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table	2.116563320159912
what do you think of the story chalaiss esquire relates asked another musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to everybody	1.5190491676330566
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests	1.2664945125579834
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary  i said the queen	1.7076261043548584
but i cannot said she i am not strong enough do you shut it  ah you do well to ask said eugénie laughing i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale  and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle darmilly passed the bolt of the padlock through	2.487128973007202
you are the chevaliers prisoner  raoul gave it up reluctantly aramis instantly seized and read it	1.3587924242019653
here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest folk  of course cried danglars	1.3822683095932007
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you	1.2682026624679565
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman	1.416243314743042
dartagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet	1.1199926137924194
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the  pharaon eh danglars  danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness	2.631321430206299
i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nîmes  we are getting to the story now  yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary	1.7486629486083984
0319m    you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse	1.1972039937973022
if i am an officer your fortune is certain for i shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our own	1.6260247230529785
i have an idea said dartagnan	1.0482892990112305
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	1.4793418645858765
steps approachi goadieu  and dantès happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friends mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage while faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery	3.0627033710479736
this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la ramee	1.2064969539642334
as to dartagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate	1.7842332124710083
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smellingsalts	1.3725248575210571
danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side	1.2529017925262451
from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years	1.4019453525543213
some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale	3.189229965209961
shall you be present in the receptionroom  no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office	1.298852801322937
the comte de la fere he cried in his turn	1.0708799362182617
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come  nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you	4.707482814788818
dartagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression	1.391144037246704
but it has not been so with mei see and always have seen during the last sixteen years	1.2945704460144043
the morrel family  in a very few minutes the count reached no	1.2027218341827393
no said morrel is someone dead in his house  the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness	1.3981337547302246
so it is agreed and if porthos makes no objection  i said porthos i will do whatever you please and besides i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good  but your future career dartagnanyour ambition porthos  our future our ambition replied dartagnan with feverish volubility	2.0666606426239014
ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere  yes sire replied athos	1.2457889318466187
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still remain  and you have returned have you not replied m bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air	1.6813302040100098
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino	1.8714652061462402
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin	1.2890770435333252
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	1.7049272060394287
dartagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted	1.5317978858947754
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with  but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked milady	1.8797810077667236
i never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more	1.5445635318756104
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear	1.377178430557251
i have not said goodmorning to you monsieur dartagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you	1.222521185874939
with the entrance of m morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste	1.8907670974731445
she was thinking of the despair of maximilian when he should be informed that madame de saintméran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy	1.479685664176941
now said dartagnan for the actual man	1.091382622718811
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth dartagnans confidence stopped there	1.373382806777954
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him	1.8236374855041504
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it  i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois  probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord  at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	18.561555862426758
but consider dartagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her	1.8727904558181763
yes but never with the same advantages said dartagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight  very good very good said the voice	1.6038939952850342
perform your duty in camp i will do mine elsewhere	1.1953885555267334
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect	1.3855464458465576
they descended into the plain by the ladder	1.1097387075424194
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me  courage madame	1.6426061391830444
well here we are at last said one of them	1.1065211296081543
jump then monsieur pistache  but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane	1.3553364276885986
are they spanish haitian or neapolitan bonds said monte cristo	1.1836776733398438
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become	1.401747465133667
i live as it were between two graves	1.1354703903198242
the comte de la fere she cried	1.043149471282959

galloping through the bushes  the count	1.0990965366363525
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor	1.5172858238220215
albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchamps confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence	1.8323246240615845
it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp	1.5140057802200317
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	1.1706023216247559
the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy	1.5591161251068115
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit and in his enthusiasm he struck a st chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight	1.7756831645965576
i am indeed to be pitied	1.0648304224014282
you edmond on the contraryyou are still young handsome dignified it is because you have had faith because you have had strength because you have had trust in god and god has sustained you	1.6556473970413208
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy  ah ha he said here you are peppino  yes was the laconic reply	1.7691601514816284
at the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars	1.2864575386047363
alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it	1.3491895198822021
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited dartagnans reply	1.3925728797912598
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture	1.314889907836914
remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy	1.1633024215698242
sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that i authorize their journey  thanks monsieur	1.354264497756958
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous	1.8539369106292725
fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a bankers wife whatever might be my confidence in my husbands good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk	1.7654308080673218
ma foi  he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow	1.1569616794586182
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes repeated	1.974068284034729
lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomewhere	1.2894121408462524
die in peace  and i said m dartagnan	1.1147159337997437
the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors the former life of the prisoner his transformation a review of his life from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur	2.1201171875
the duc de bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of sedan and the title of prince granted to him and to those belonging to his house	1.5939464569091797
from two oclock till five franz and albert followed in the  fête  exchanging handfuls of  confetti  with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight	2.106471300125122
the contract was read during a profound silence	1.1293659210205078
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven oclock struck	1.2681081295013428
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop	1.1651947498321533
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence	1.8374724388122559
pardieu  said dartagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted  pardieu  it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friends house	1.6203306913375854
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saintroch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived at m danglars door just at the same time that villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg sainthonoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house	2.197270631790161
another way of getting hanged  so you refuse my request  to be sure i dofuriously  the pretty landlady was desolate	1.4132167100906372
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court  and what are they  oh he doesnt stand well with his eminence  mouston said porthos saddle vulcan and bayard  and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud  no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some ceremony  ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit  oh	3.1444430351257324
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock	1.4436414241790771
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera	2.90118670463562
as we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at cours la reine	1.9525214433670044
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	2.296905755996704
only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat  mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	1.5837562084197998
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as confessor	1.4178072214126587
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat	1.4517172574996948
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheardof that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs	3.806419849395752
at length with a violent effort at selfcontrol  the name of that woman he said	1.1877318620681763
what will our two friends say	1.08856201171875
why have we not a grimaud near every prince  patience replied mazarin with his italian smile that may happen one day but in the meantime  well in the meantime  i shall still take precautions  and he wrote to dartagnan to hasten his return	1.9863024950027466
of the important cities given up by henry iv	1.1922504901885986
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners  mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of dartagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said  i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away  no replied dartagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour	3.1918857097625732
there is in london i hope some establishment like that of the magdalens or of the repentant daughters	1.2988389730453491
i will have my eye upon you for i shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return wellwe will settle our account  ah monseigneur cried dartagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure	2.0163609981536865
a fearful day when today we find our friends  yes but under what circumstances  tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done  things look black enough replied porthos i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt  silence cried the gascon do not utter that name  but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english  dartagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass stupidity	5.15702486038208
you see i am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should cease	1.2323830127716064
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	1.488860845565796
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	1.3469549417495728
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me  fortune has been kind to you then	1.4101831912994385
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100000 francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in parisamongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just nowit was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place	5.857212543487549
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last	1.496677041053772
and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gateto be close to you without really seeing youhave i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength	2.3824446201324463
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	1.5324774980545044
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk	1.2260571718215942
it is not very difficult to say  tell us then dartagnan  we are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to france	1.5786813497543335
grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened	1.5700026750564575
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	1.097109317779541
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him	1.2019890546798706
on arriving in paris dartagnan found a letter from m de tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the musketeers	1.459993600845337
tell me what i am to do for this  a very easy thing if your horse isnt tired  i tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to drive  towards the louvres  ah i know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over there  exactly so i merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelleenserval	2.7207562923431396

yieldyou yield to me do you not  a giant had seized also aramiss two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp	1.5753610134124756
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket	1.2829704284667969
at this moment planchet brought out athoss horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle	1.2643775939941406
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence  aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens manner	2.0069451332092285
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips	1.2226979732513428
adieu gentlemen  and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away	1.3304569721221924
which is my best cavalry horse  vulcan  and the best hack  bayard  what horse dost thou choose for thyself  i like rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me  strong thinkest thou  half norman half mecklenburger will go night and day  that will do for us	2.562978982925415

what say you to that monsieur du vallon he added in a low tone to porthos	1.1690497398376465
your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want  monsieur dartagnan  i will answer for everything  nothing is so catching as confidence	1.5990023612976074
they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor davrigny	1.3477628231048584
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze	1.3683383464813232
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly  did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china	3.317105770111084
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	1.2083605527877808
it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad	1.3020789623260498
i saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me  well inquired dantès	1.602495551109314
from la rochelle and you  from england  buckingham  dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of him	1.464665174484253
athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said trifles only trifles that was his favorite word	1.3782942295074463
after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre	1.9441081285476685
this was in fact a custom familiar to him	1.1354961395263672
dont alarm yourself my little benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and i will contrive it  well ill seeill try to contrive some way said andrea	1.858574628829956
in fact m bonacieux having left his house at seven oclock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence	2.0705273151397705
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured	1.1109528541564941
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her  albert shook his head and looked thoughtful	1.5640721321105957
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued	1.4755189418792725
what is that again he asked	1.0790319442749023
i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage  bertuccio bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the door he paused and then said at what oclock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready  at five oclock replied the count	2.0502452850341797
he is gone to noisy  how dost thou know  ah faith	1.2240397930145264
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain	1.8513212203979492
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal	1.1796971559524536
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck	1.1822718381881714
why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair  he took care not to do so monsieur on the contrary he came up to me and said it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i since he knows everything and i know nothing	1.9788423776626587
you love me my beautiful queen and you will weep for me  oh my god my god cried anne of austria this is more than i can bear	1.4254924058914185
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think  ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper  madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart  and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen	4.534420013427734
dartagnan retired to bednot to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening	1.2360767126083374
you have an excellent memory milady  but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france  the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness	2.2441623210906982
who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign  a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m de richelieu  who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine  a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal  who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested  an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me  you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine  that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine  my friends monsieur the queen shook her head	9.252641677856445
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you  sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report  as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist	5.973321437835693
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard	1.398626446723938
this would have been a method of reckoning time had not dantès long ceased to do so	1.2814213037490845
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern	1.129012942314148
on the entrance of the newcomers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising	1.513550043106079
order of the king i tell you	1.0775154829025269
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young kings valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months  the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner	8.195568084716797
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph	1.2913042306900024
dartagnan saw that the moment was come	1.0888475179672241
thanks my brave friend cried milady and when shall i be avenged  tomorrowimmediatelywhen you please  milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward dartagnan	1.7400383949279785

well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	1.1996604204177856

when i say i want i mean the queen wants them	1.1427819728851318

never more to be separated  why as to thati think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country  the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it  as for me you must know i cannot possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can  but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent  certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life  where are these papers then  here they are  andrea seized the certificate of his fathers marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents	22.96832275390625
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris	1.904517412185669

she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	1.4213436841964722
on his side dartagnan became more cautious also	1.1528245210647583
dartagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had notwhatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subjectbeen able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence	1.8892749547958374
cannot monsieur cromwell wait a little  yes but i said mordaunt	1.1885002851486206

will you go up with me  i follow you  monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories	1.336653232574463

show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed  unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke  this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects  oh my lord my lord  that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public  but your honor will soon be called so generally  i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	5.661862373352051
the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers	1.549609899520874
oh nothing but a scratch said dartagnan	1.112119197845459

you asked me the cause of my being late and why i come disguised	1.2143547534942627
dartagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	1.5119925737380981
grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust but la ramee who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art passed his knife which had an iron blade to the duke	2.0391845703125

the valet then left the room	1.073635458946228
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness	1.5767440795898438
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door  madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay  on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard	2.7590861320495605
but now you are happy  doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain  and your present happiness has it softened your heart  my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	1.7274885177612305

maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot	1.3103058338165283
and a comforting one too added dartagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man	1.3066693544387817

free to leave me  leave you	1.0878278017044067
tomorrow morning  dartagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him	1.4239296913146973
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor	1.3095033168792725
the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise dartagnan had made and opening the door said come in  all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that dartagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard	2.5631704330444336
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph	1.6252262592315674

the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword but the name of m de tréville and that of m de la trémouille commanded a little reflection	2.29618239402771

but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtiers expression could not be understood	1.3706258535385132
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a ropedancer	2.1006228923797607
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united  but where is such a lackey to be found  not to be found cried athos	1.5750653743743896

upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme	1.1814026832580566

since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me	1.3372164964675903
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	1.5115238428115845
she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration	1.4088120460510254
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud	1.1550582647323608

bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master	1.145622968673706
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask	1.4266963005065918
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars	1.3233973979949951

he must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial	1.9293535947799683
goodbye count  morcerf took his hat and left the room	1.1531174182891846

i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune	1.3216369152069092
destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth  and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room	2.2860262393951416
the chocolate was inoffensive for m de villefort felt no effects	1.1884281635284424

after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth  yes said the count yes  i raised the stones and found  a ropeladder and some tools  how do you know that asked the guide in astonishment	1.9612098932266235
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely reechoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty	2.685375690460205

scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him	1.432227373123169
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart	1.6793824434280396
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim	1.160797357559204

and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes  i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous  so young said albert forgetting at the moment the counts command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name  haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured  εἰπέspeak  nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness  40068m    speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say  haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile	28.505693435668945

then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her  dartagnan then related the poisoning of mme	1.2851722240447998
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said i thought proper to insist but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself	3.86535906791687
it was nearly eight oclock when they set out again	1.1280837059020996

an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones	1.6893360614776611
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers	1.2480202913284302
the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse	1.5648592710494995
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out  he did get out nevertheless  do you think of escaping in the same way  i am a prisoner then  parbleu said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour  and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted	3.3461313247680664

upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman  the most satisfactory part of the matter said dartagnan is that there remains no trace of it  she had a son observed athos	1.7517856359481812
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien with piercing eyes a large brow and a thin face which was made still longer by a  royal  or  imperial  as it is now called surmounted by a pair of mustaches	2.044112205505371
come come murmured dartagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort	1.6666113138198853

of course we do replied albert	1.0940524339675903
i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman  you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal  oh no certainly not  well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me  but this secret is not mine and i cannot reveal it in this manner  you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan with chagrin	3.7463579177856445

it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done  but m dépinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently  still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family	2.9722676277160645

it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony  sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved methat i have given nothing to that gallant officer dartagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond  as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger	3.6035709381103516
he still lives  are you quite sure of it  i am he  there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature	1.5267733335494995
we started a stag of ten branches	1.131455421447754
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him	1.2174956798553467

dartagnan dismissed planchet and requested his visitor to be seated	1.1869245767593384

all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end  badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber	2.213862657546997
and sobeing beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and richand that is happiness sirwhy do you call me unhappy  danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation	2.361133575439453
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable	1.2202774286270142
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	1.4123921394348145
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastilewhere he remained for twelve long yearswhen his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court	3.8231983184814453

having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces	1.589434027671814
dartagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that night	1.9168435335159302

revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	1.3228646516799927
excuse my putting such a question to you  it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction	1.3324369192123413

whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by nighttime i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hardbound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery	6.218655109405518
a conjugal scene   as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down	1.2215362787246704
sire it is something more opaque than the fog  indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color  it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos	1.7983278036117554
when they were within ten paces of him dartagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to them	1.435591459274292
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	1.2271442413330078

ah  pardieu  continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity  monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange	1.8286854028701782
haydée said he you well know  why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young greek	1.3259526491165161
what is the matter madame said mazarin uneasily	1.0948266983032227
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister	1.167015790939331
horrible replied raoul especially in expression  yes yes said de guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost  well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor	4.462198257446289

then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse	1.5825854539871216
when i return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he doesnt speak a word of french i take him into my service	1.598351001739502

they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation	1.2779706716537476
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight	1.9637457132339478
it appears the conquerors had something else to do  well  well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire  oh athos said aramis truly you are a great man  porthos nodded in sign of agreement	2.4894802570343018

dartagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it  these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth	2.877373695373535
without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them	1.2846556901931763

athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine	1.1355911493301392

i am a physiognomist i assure you  dartagnan went out first as had been agreed upon	1.2367503643035889
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon	1.1411007642745972
in ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be there  he then took peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage	1.7071847915649414

dartagnans ball took off his enemys hat	1.1139914989471436
one of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all three	1.1887755393981934

oh you do not understand me	1.0383437871932983
psdo pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house	1.1982851028442383
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	1.1869080066680908
i understand said monte cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion  ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions	1.704501986503601
0147m    who could know that i was here already said the young man	1.1436009407043457
they laugh best who laugh last  having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawingroom whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée dantin	2.560037136077881
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	2.143583059310913
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message	1.2828941345214844
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature	1.4695918560028076
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming	1.501792073249817
hes heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head	1.2678147554397583
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me  monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance  dartagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athoss last remark he stopped short	2.2789032459259033
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination	1.355696201324463
that instant the arm of porthos fell	1.0918023586273193
the trial  at eight oclock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamps door	1.206177830696106
i know he cannot save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence  against whom  against my murderer  did you recognize him  yes it was benedetto  the young corsican  himself  your comrade  yes	1.6854721307754517
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets  villefort went immediately	1.267298698425293
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling  ali a horse for m de morcerfquick	1.3659805059432983
it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris	1.3251672983169556
make yourself easy we are quite alone said andrea besides we are conversing in italian  well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs down  monsieur cavalcanti said andrea do you believe in fairy tales  i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them  you have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold	3.570941209793091
oh if you know him tell me  by a man of from forty to fortyfive years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple  that is he that is he but his name  ah his name	1.7369043827056885

and that one if i mistake not a lamprey  just so	1.1891272068023682
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france  one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague ont	2.091423511505127
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations	1.4135743379592896
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur dherblay and myself to do in your service	1.2545298337936401
who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning	1.1867769956588745
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand	1.9430255889892578
the father of m de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of moneya thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready witin default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto  fidelis et fortis	4.534856796264648
where is he  there in the salon	1.0920917987823486
put your names into a hat and draw lots  a good idea said dartagnan	1.239774465560913
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved  and if you wished to die you would choose this death count  yes  morrel extended his hand	3.294745683670044
one day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often	1.347333550453186
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you  i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	1.478739619255066
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience i see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be aramis  it was indeed aramis	1.6841288805007935
have i the honor of addressing the abbé busoni asked the visitor	1.1863291263580322
he is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for yourself  by the way said the major you know i have only the 2000 francs which the abbé busoni sent me this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and  and you want money that is a matter of course my dear m cavalcanti	2.5416204929351807
well in that case we can manage famously said dartagnan which of the two horses will you ridethat which you bought or the one that was given to you  that which was given to me assuredly	1.6584402322769165
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishmentinstead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridorsinstead of the court filled with bales of goods reechoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom	2.959429979324341
a gentleman in his opinionand according to dartagnans portrait of him the stranger must be a gentlemanwould be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter	1.4300671815872192
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building  the dog again shook his head as if to say no  then said the prisoner lets think who it can be	2.524970054626465
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône	1.426253318786621
hold your tongue said he and let me answer	1.1296815872192383
where for  for la rochelle  he need not sail cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind	1.3292591571807861
as soon as the door was closed  sire said aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the london executioner has vanished	1.3893977403640747
it was three oclock when he threw himself on the bed	1.1231834888458252
dartagnan here  himself  but thats impossible	1.1112781763076782
he has the true military style  what ho said grimaud	1.197929859161377
m bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired	1.2323718070983887
this tranquillity proved one thingthat dartagnan did not yet know milady	1.182727336883545
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall see  the two friends saluted the duke	1.3793162107467651
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian	1.5891906023025513
you shall relate them to me my child	1.094322919845581
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable	1.1167360544204712
he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthosthat is to say exactly upon the baldric	1.9333301782608032
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer	1.4162112474441528
my friends thats exactly like me	1.0912117958068848
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself	1.2778626680374146
your profession  first i was a forger answered andrea as calmly as possible then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin  a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly	1.928300142288208
but the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies	1.1889750957489014
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove  everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak	1.4553767442703247
oliver cromwell  very well monsieur mordaunt said mazarin give me this second letter and sit down  the young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat	1.5835446119308472
in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a cloak	1.3447283506393433
oh enough of thisenough of this he cried let me save the last on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb	1.7342742681503296
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming	1.9504470825195312
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor  tell me who this man was cried the young officer	1.7907309532165527
i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping albert on the steps	1.2354063987731934
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother	1.3636292219161987
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	1.2042880058288574
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited  dartagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place	1.979016900062561
if they had discovered miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends	1.5602033138275146
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me  they had long since passed to dessert and cigars	1.9951539039611816
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars	1.101387619972229
hes not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite  my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do	2.193044662475586
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and iat least i understood it so  when will it be our turn to think of these things	1.4716898202896118
at one corner where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off	3.0891945362091064
in ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman  ah	1.2092939615249634
it is not here he cried	1.0568574666976929
and he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same thing	1.2692625522613525

i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud  grimaud replied athos	1.205680012702942
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose	1.3749607801437378
de morcerf said baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse	1.1745234727859497
try and make an effort to do so my good man said davrigny	1.1679706573486328
the rain of blood chapter 46	1.1192750930786133
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated	1.4608205556869507
i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me	1.1993536949157715
another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground covered with blood and almost fainting	1.332283616065979
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was satisfied	1.2380871772766113
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am  that gentleman i say what has become of him  deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful	1.6666878461837769
then we must fly said he	1.075810194015503
but though i cannot give my own name not possessing one i can tell them my fathers	1.2458316087722778
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	6.989405155181885
ah its all one said the host i have lost two customers but this one remains of whom i am pretty certain for some days to come	1.4813517332077026
besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days	1.353128433227539
it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison	1.7357248067855835
it is by his courage please observe by his courage alone that a gentleman can make his way nowadays	1.305851936340332
psi sign my full name for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials  the poor duke became perfectly giddy	1.720770239830017
5 scott of course the son of an illfated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy deaththe abbot ch	2.284606695175171
for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it  my lord yes it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your lookthe thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a womanwere grouped around me on that fatal evening but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered	2.7985100746154785
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door	1.1611567735671997
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	1.1482115983963013
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me	1.2566730976104736
this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus	1.5042762756347656
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame he asked coldly	1.8072729110717773
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	1.2297019958496094
he glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty	1.1957658529281616
arrived there he fastened according to the orders of his master both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurators door then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was completed	1.9403959512710571
i present my letter from the queen to the superior and i bring back the dear treasure i go to seeknot into lorraine not into belgium but to paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at la rochelle	1.935453176498413
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate valentine will not die  a superhuman joy expanded the old mans eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	1.9253555536270142
now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was  ah to be sure replied châteaurenaud the lovely venetian is it not  herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile	2.333188533782959
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room	1.5445202589035034
20185m    gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable	1.2987686395645142
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke dangouleme were called the petitsmaitres	3.142852306365967
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine  excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips	1.2675915956497192
wretch said he to the young man who since the death of buckingham had regained that coolness and selfpossession which never after abandoned him wretch	1.4532791376113892
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	1.4928606748580933
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back	1.4185727834701538
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea  i am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes	1.4820404052734375
athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door	1.3561015129089355
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wifes writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows  you know that i was a good mother since it was for my sons sake i became criminal	1.805955410003662
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril	1.3169710636138916
since you demand my resignation i retire  then said aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	1.360539197921753
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive  you think then that i may rely on the counts promises  certainly i do  you are sure he will keep his word with me  to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts	2.001131057739258
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are  no it is not worth while  well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece  all right  he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs	3.1727230548858643
just so  then you are called monsieur grimaud  the traveler made a sign of assent	1.2446436882019043
serpent muttered dartagnan i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name  aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read dartagnan  the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt  i hope sir said he you have no objection to make  none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot	2.946183919906616
yes that is the very boy hes patronized by bazin  ah yes i know  of what importance is this little reptile to you asked porthos	1.4671586751937866
decidedly said danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to think	1.4951584339141846
hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst  bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand	1.4843802452087402
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo	1.390934705734253
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	1.1266063451766968
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal	1.1184529066085815
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter	1.2356172800064087
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water	1.2438945770263672
hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines  on	1.2108970880508423

as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris	1.1723992824554443
i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary  there has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise	2.081049680709839
lord de winter came toward five oclock in the evening	1.1105046272277832
it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotinewe say guillotine because the roman  mandaïa  is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument7 the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference	2.3020641803741455
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other	1.3837635517120361
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrinis account of vampas having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at portovecchio for the sole purpose of landing them	3.874265670776367
ah  pardieu  is that you said porthos to dartagnan	1.0813703536987305
dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave la pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots	1.5621899366378784
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing  it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	1.838318109512329
if i am guilty if i have committed the crimes you accuse me of shrieked milady take me before a tribunal	1.3351116180419922
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs  bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs	1.2062753438949585
mamma mamma said i are we really to be killed and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations	1.4955378770828247
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there	1.2197221517562866
now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing	2.152024030685425
you are a hundred times too good  begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight	1.30499267578125
get up  he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos	1.4830461740493774
tell me how trévilleyou know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting  and louis xiii	1.3200346231460571
dartagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing	1.1574798822402954
see see said the young girl	1.055094838142395
dartagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by planchet at the same pace	1.2563480138778687
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son	1.6957085132598877
a family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family affair concerned nobody	1.2849000692367554
if it be so we trust your eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position  and if it were an interrogatory replied the cardinal	1.538276195526123
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information  you think resumed mazarin that rochefort  he was cardinal richelieus creature my lord	1.560401439666748
alas murmured edmond can it be  he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open	1.5741651058197021
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in	1.4303852319717407
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword	1.096920371055603
it is he exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos it is he	1.151112675666809
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made	1.6206828355789185
the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it	1.4310569763183594
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace  you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to dartagnan who pressed it respectfully	1.5664048194885254
peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch	1.4215261936187744
dartagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses	2.4500396251678467
if he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with him  what to do with him answered the prince	1.3766971826553345
i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans	1.4208801984786987
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word	1.7057393789291382
what is it then  mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance	1.2683380842208862
0283m    to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure	1.3645145893096924
two persons passed near meallow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word  this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel  oh yes very gloomy my friend	2.2969162464141846
condé himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him	1.3342621326446533
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides	1.2473552227020264
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it	1.3605996370315552
let us pursue him and we shall overtake him  my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him	2.1431314945220947
so i will not abandon this bouquet   pardieu  returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude  the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the  contadini  the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his buttonhole	2.4356329441070557
did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting  why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these dont make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others  at least you must admire morianis style and execution  i never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a womans  my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please  the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way	10.432862281799316
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends	1.3317923545837402
as soon as possible  i am at your command sir shall we return together  if not unpleasant to you  on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure  thus the future father and soninlaw stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy	2.003124237060547
i dare say such a thing might be had  very possibly  and a pair of oxen  as easily found as the cart  then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed	1.8946542739868164
one would think it had been placed here on purpose  get on it thats it friend  and dartagnan coughed	1.3580344915390015
i only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all i require  i love a young girl count  do you love her much  more than my life  another hope defeated said the count	1.590869426727295
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse	1.186081051826477
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role	1.1146345138549805
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell	1.1720476150512695
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday  no your excellency replied the valet de chambre the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag	1.8297665119171143
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness	1.0903412103652954
are you going  really that is a good ideatwo hours have i been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going	1.6058989763259888
dartagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume	1.149864912033081
at length m de tréville himself returned	1.095157504081726
the papers said something about it did they not  then you believe the papers  inot the least in the world only i fancied that the honest  messager  was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches  well thats what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph  so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly 1700000 francs this month  not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss   diable  said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate fortune  thirdrate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that  certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate fortunes	6.634907245635986
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from youyour misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes  in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it  poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet  well  well i must tell you	6.216545581817627
it is enough replied the prince	1.0649776458740234

however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	1.5652639865875244
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void  yes said villefort but i warn m dépinay that during my lifetime my fathers will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained  40032m    sir said franz i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine i have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine	5.067755699157715
thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes	1.4029392004013062
but allow me to say that you must have been very young theni was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memoryin what manner could these events concern you	1.8286651372909546
all is ready for tomorrow evening	1.109994888305664
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison	2.0525777339935303
it was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey	1.1620476245880127

sdeath he cried with his gascon accent	1.0955392122268677
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed	1.2761857509613037
i want air that is all  will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase	1.313215732574463
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and dartagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends	1.661590814590454
on arriving at the kings private antechamber m de tréville found la chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find m de la trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king	2.1862738132476807
what do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed  yes  she was married asked aramis	1.2514556646347046
god has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	1.9634287357330322
if you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me   no signature	1.4579445123672485
at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal	1.3342046737670898
dartagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies	1.1683818101882935
the minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to madame beauvais  it is time for the king to go to bed call laporte  the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with anger	2.783881664276123
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	1.1358253955841064
paris is a horrible place in summer	1.1227068901062012
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts	1.2202202081680298
you see monsieur what the new world has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe	1.3281000852584839
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food	1.3404028415679932

cloud but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named	1.58065664768219
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours grace	1.822073221206665
the conversation took a cheerful turn	1.098758339881897

it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man	1.1707675457000732
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès	2.1891658306121826
at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move	1.7042982578277588
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor  and that in the presence of witnesses	1.2737300395965576

the friends went to bed early but neither of them slept	1.2121700048446655
speak i beg you  i will never confess that but to the manwho should read to the bottom of my soul  dartagnan looked at kitty for the second time	1.4486902952194214
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars	1.4192336797714233

the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands had doubled pomègue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board	2.97739577293396
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor	1.6356970071792603
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details	1.219680666923523
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it  but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with dartagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter	1.719024658203125
dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	1.4007409811019897
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself	1.6628168821334839
adieu  thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him	1.3926185369491577
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune	1.695751428604126

the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts	1.7096290588378906
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground	1.1496672630310059
in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wifes and daughters jewels and a portion of his plate	2.4244396686553955
look at that wallwithout a single windowwhich tells you fine things about mazarins gratitude  yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur dartagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him  poor dartagnan said athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves	2.661364793777466
he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	1.356037974357605
tell me quickly my time is not my own  monsieur said dartagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it  it is indeed a favor young man replied m de tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe	3.9144303798675537
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	1.1798961162567139
porthos abated no doubt of his toogreat confidence by his adventure of chantilly played with skill and prudence	1.3247207403182983
he is then the same englishman whom i metatahyes indeed	1.1411634683609009

at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	1.8232240676879883
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say  well  supposing the assertion to be really true  a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor   ma foi  we live in times when there is much to which we must submit  that is precisely the fault of the age  and do you undertake to reform it  yes as far as i am personally concerned  well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow  yes i own it  are you quite impervious to good advice  not when it comes from a friend  and do you account me that title  certainly i do  well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject  from whom  from haydée  why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affairwhat can she do in it  she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to  i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition  you reject this means of information then  i domost decidedly  then let me offer one more word of advice  do so then but let it be the last  you do not wish to hear it perhaps  on the contrary i request it  do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchampvisit him alone  that would be contrary to all custom  your case is not an ordinary one  and what is your reason for advising me to go alone  because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp  explain yourself  i will do so	87.06087493896484

i was then obliged to come back again	1.108206033706665

but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	2.6573328971862793
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i dont like to humiliate people  then your duchess is still at the waters asked dartagnan	1.514836311340332

the queen smiled but instead of answering  see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame  then turning toward her daughter  what do you want henrietta she demanded	2.076998472213745

during this time dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests	1.3712358474731445
but to her great surprise dartagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos  yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better  when will you do that  immediately i hope  ah	2.35088849067688

gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m de monte cristo and myself  possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life	2.772106647491455
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father	2.3167145252227783
he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined them	1.2042354345321655

then he saw through the whole thing	1.0871896743774414
upon gaining this advantage dartagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman	1.4492237567901611
i do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause	1.2488025426864624

while dartagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors aramis had joined his companions so that on returning home dartagnan found the reunion complete	1.5896220207214355
i know who it is then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said  i wish you joy my lord  impudent fellow cried dartagnan you will get me turned off  the gate groaned on its hinges and dartagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal	2.5656869411468506

i will continue then resumed aramis	1.0769037008285522
albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up	2.1235454082489014

sir cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me unheard	1.3113739490509033

we have something very important to say to him  i understand said athos but why not porthos	1.2100484371185303

however he had not ventured thus far to draw back	1.1478257179260254

but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror	1.5178332328796387
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle darmillys fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantios malediction on desdemona	1.4248355627059937

france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eightyfive departmentsi say eightyfive because i do not include corsicayou will not find then in these eightyfive departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp	2.385808229446411

his task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him	1.2081904411315918
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done	1.7043734788894653
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties	1.1680383682250977
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow	1.2679933309555054
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded	1.1864728927612305
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch	1.5227186679840088
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him	1.236981749534607
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent	1.6919647455215454
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself dartagnan reached notre dame	1.4355103969573975

you must dress him up during my absence	1.1431480646133423
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box	1.260369896888733
for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to mazarin as every gentleman ought to be  hush	1.3760074377059937
well this is what you have to say said dartagnan  my lord your sisterinlaw is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth but she could not marry your brother being already married in france and having been  dartagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at athos	2.1416730880737305
well tempter what more do you want with me said dartagnan	1.1693167686462402
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs	1.1733108758926392
you madame have only sought to increase your own and i am convinced that you have succeeded	1.2334412336349487
yes my lord the pure parliament  what do you mean by the pure parliament	1.2263422012329102

returning to her own room kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet	1.5393447875976562
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	2.0673811435699463
barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness	1.2014496326446533
death is depicted on his face	1.0966392755508423
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him  and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him	1.4065243005752563
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal	1.7308859825134277
however scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is scarcely had the emperor reentered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readershe found on the table there louis xviiis halffilled snuffboxscarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad	4.7523722648620605
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so	1.3709306716918945
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag	2.1191086769104004
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil	1.1758971214294434
milady sprang out of bed and opened the window	1.1104588508605957
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin  i cried dartagnan not in the least  you spoke of a mission  did i	1.9153552055358887
two or three times a week	1.0794180631637573
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you  and has he found consolation  he has at least found peace  and does he ever expect to be happy  he hopes so maximilian  the young mans head fell on his breast	1.889879822731018
all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you	1.6277706623077393
bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband	1.5798839330673218
they fire like grooms said porthos	1.1002898216247559
it bleeds seemingly  oh its nothing said dartagnan	1.1708924770355225
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will  i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor davrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house	2.193830728530884
so said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins  monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you	2.310901641845703
the money is nothing that letter was everything	1.123245120048523
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes	1.3997104167938232
she goes into england said athos	1.0954670906066895
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace	1.5566166639328003
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother	1.8653393983840942
30321m    doubt if you please but i am sure of what i say	1.1660356521606445
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch one	1.6175028085708618
do you keep a journal  no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself  do you talk in your sleep  30275m    i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember  the color mounted to the baronesss face and villefort turned awfully pale	2.102585554122925
returned the influence of m de saintméran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	1.3184608221054077
the jesuit persisted in his opinion	1.085859775543213
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary	1.2555949687957764
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold	2.310072660446167
have me arrested on the part of the queen said he and ii will appeal to his eminence  at once mme	1.3545395135879517

the bastion saintgervais   on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends dartagnan found them assembled in the same chamber	1.3228093385696411
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris	1.1365214586257935
upon my word you would make caesar afraid  the matter is replied dartagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman  and you complain of that said porthos	1.7235904932022095
what does it signify to you if i am murdered	1.1245996952056885
the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the southeast they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world	1.7989609241485596
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors	2.0757668018341064
i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good  i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated	1.5332581996917725
yes my lord  well enough to question him in that language  yes my lord  question him then  raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion	1.5039870738983154
first madame who are you  who am i	1.1186940670013428
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions	1.5084460973739624
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly	1.6459286212921143
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance	1.2012686729431152
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache	1.326731562614441
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed  at what	1.1730709075927734
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m danglars in promoting a new railway line you m de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m debray in pacifying a kingdom you m de châteaurenaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride	2.456920623779297
dartagnan lost no time in useless compliments	1.1303684711456299
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses	1.3312158584594727
the storm broke about ten oclock	1.1136517524719238
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbés room  ah	1.1844301223754883
i have eight men on guard you know	1.1105455160140991
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	1.148552417755127
the confidence with which dartagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the minister	1.2690629959106445
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count	1.1581534147262573
is that not true monsieur bonacieux	1.0797333717346191
why it is after one oclock  your home is a paradise porthos one takes no note of time	1.3427867889404297
what do you say said louise	1.0645043849945068
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne  the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold	1.7978888750076294
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan	1.196800947189331
did the romans eat them said the gardenerate dormice  i have read so in petronius said the count	1.2948532104492188
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château dif and the tower of planier	1.400473713874817
next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieuxcolombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by dartagnana circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey	2.6575353145599365
you do not like dantès  i never like upstarts  then tell me all you know about the catalane  i know nothing for certain only i have seen things which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries  what have you seencome tell me  well every time i have seen mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin  really and you think this cousin pays her attentions  i only suppose so	5.352752208709717
at length they arrived at the famous room	1.0829651355743408
you jest said she in a hollow voice	1.1023178100585938
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks	1.146696925163269
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry  aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him	1.6064285039901733
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me	1.317927598953247
and whatever might beconsidering the violent character of miladythe danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her	1.7922043800354004
silence said felton i hear footsteps  we are discovered  there was a silence of several seconds	1.2871041297912598
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me  to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	1.8109629154205322
monsieur porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left  good said aramis taking a purse which bazin presented to him	1.7576760053634644
your fellowcountryman bonaparte became emperor we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican	1.2749041318893433
either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk the first curé the first priest you may meet	1.5892225503921509
the english who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their camp	1.645792841911316
we shall require it  yes gentlemen said dartagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do  this new attack made no impression on mordaunt	1.9524304866790771
dartagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting	1.6056545972824097
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction	1.250435471534729
morrel said châteaurenaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal  morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission	1.4749951362609863
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur	1.2304831743240356
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct	1.164537787437439
here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing  the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils	1.8326767683029175
now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow  be it so said beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth i submit and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours  well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately	3.591468334197998
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée dantin to m danglars	1.4932234287261963
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	1.4846869707107544
oh good lord said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you	1.182347297668457
at last said aramis we are ready are we  yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the  because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	2.09637188911438
the presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no guard	1.5276894569396973
when i awoke a fresh meal was served	1.14816415309906
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past  yes  well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man  extraordinary did you say  yes  you have known him for some time then  scarcely longer than eight or ten days  and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days	5.641416549682617
i think so answered albert in a firm tone	1.122081995010376
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for i am aware that m de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on mea favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness  villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman	13.444708824157715
dartagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find planchet in any of them	1.359350562095642
danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf	1.6620614528656006
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy	1.5087239742279053
besides it has perhaps been her majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly	1.3601144552230835
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	1.4644088745117188
at halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert	1.7127634286880493
this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels	1.2672975063323975
he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged  de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head	1.5088289976119995
my dear raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked	1.2350174188613892
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving dartagnan how glad i am to see you  why so planchet asked the young man	1.304213047027588
alas my friends replied m morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected  oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercédès	1.6429394483566284
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries	1.2513009309768677
m noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal	1.683549165725708
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help me to recover my spirits tomorrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent	2.0708584785461426
there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them	2.097562313079834
i cannot hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as i should ever require  stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of  i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known	5.655124187469482
comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story	1.6014176607131958
turn chartreux or trappist and relate your secrets but as for me i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and i do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening	1.8199325799942017
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool  sweet child murmured monte cristo	1.4235647916793823
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever	1.9890129566192627
my master will go to dinner  and after dinner  he will sleep an hour  then  he is going to the opera  are you sure of it asked albert	1.4637689590454102
oh how feverish you are we must not send for a notary but for a doctor  a doctor said she shrugging her shoulders i am not ill i am thirstythat is all  30323m    what are you drinking dear grandmamma  the same as usual my dear my glass is there on the tablegive it to me valentine valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre	3.596627950668335
i command you not to stirattempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings	1.3507040739059448
this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions	1.1644607782363892
excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocketbook or dressingcase  and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visitingcards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer	2.2633509635925293
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	1.299315094947815
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people	1.2526081800460815
you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me  adieu then until five oclock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one  at tréport  yes or in the neighborhood  but can we travel fortyeight leagues in eight hours  easily said monte cristo	2.059227705001831
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saintantoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porters absence	2.0949008464813232
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money	1.1403650045394897
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers	1.2902759313583374
and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where dartagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near newcastle	2.594649314880371
