certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow	464.7233581542969
his head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell	210.88050842285156
whose is the ocean upon which we look	165.1375274658203
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle darmilly of whom he had heard much	121.96037292480469
here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them  and dartagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty	162.8764190673828
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly	160.8169708251953
his house has been full ever since	399.7366943359375
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty	188.9266357421875
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed	233.7930450439453
that is all very simple you had business in england  monseigneur said dartagnan quite confused i went  hunting at windsor or elsewherethat concerns nobody	395.4925842285156
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful earth has become distasteful to me and human voices distract me	403.1599426269531
and now raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of france for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens it is not so bad for a novice  oh sir said raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits i had forgotten it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england a gentleman who when i pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you  what is his name  i did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although i thought from his accent he was an englishman  ah said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be	116.8160629272461
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure  porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice	183.3495330810547
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair	235.87425231933594
a rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	125.97457885742188
who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams	212.66342163085938
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked dartagnan	57.088890075683594
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill	191.7392578125
i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls and  pardieu  i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each	154.9088134765625
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement	375.793212890625
alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully	91.8311767578125
salite  said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant	36.038124084472656
it is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows expedition  chatillon and flamarens looked at each other	158.27935791015625
the opera of  parisina  was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia	131.14976501464844
dont you think so dartagnan  i think so indeed cried he	104.79730987548828
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview	430.2210388183594
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you	46.98558807373047
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where valentines had been	110.7522201538086
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	167.77532958984375
he extended a hand to raoul and said  my young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions	148.49449157714844
ill manage it somehow you will see  but said dartagnan now i think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight  nothing at all said groslow	83.28710174560547
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest	408.7664794921875
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well	170.51983642578125
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	192.89151000976562
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content  no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chaseloving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon  and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerfs remark	188.1093292236328
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks were	244.04592895507812
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains	451.0714111328125
from what he has told me i know you now	37.04423522949219
monsieur said the cardinal are you a dartagnan from béarn  yes monseigneur replied the young man	65.73965454101562
we went by bologna perugia and rome  ah yestrue mademoiselle exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought	177.938232421875
and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first timethis garden the actual scene of my crimemust have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause	181.0554656982422
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so dartagnan declares  just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door	403.07501220703125
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches	127.94355773925781
the baron dépinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged  do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him	110.21964263916016
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord  faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling	329.4280700683594
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the army	59.09162139892578
i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps	61.40315628051758
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat	138.18536376953125
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil	148.3695831298828
let us horsewhip the fine gentleman said others	432.92633056640625
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to turn	116.54493713378906
on the next day mathieu molé the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the cardinal de retz was equal to that of the duc de beaufort and the prince de condéin other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in francehad been attacked in his turn	107.51982879638672
when dartagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve oclock was striking	115.62987518310547
the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually	235.79574584960938
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	71.03767395019531
one would think we had tipped the wink  what could i do said porthos	152.87835693359375
well said andreamy servants coat and my hat  ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold  but what am i to do  you	147.57395935058594
you are a brave fellow  as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used	148.0004425048828
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos	164.40652465820312
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four  gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best  what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues	239.39012145996094
he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london	49.023193359375
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him	129.29632568359375
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous operabox more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat pocket	349.6158142089844
he took his army to the priests where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornets who performed wonders but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal  dartagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companionsas the breakfast at the priests could only be counted as half a repastin return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him	203.8936004638672
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately	79.04347229003906
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself	215.4590301513672
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend	170.33285522460938
there it is cried the jesuit the world still speaks within you in a loud voice  altisimâ voce	191.5209503173828
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	391.7847595214844
you lose ground you are turning	181.8567657470703
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here  laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we might be off during the time  if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queens service  not at all said dartagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost  you are right sir always right said anne of austria	166.28485107421875
already dantès had visited this maritime bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy freetraders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds	241.8531951904297
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip	134.34141540527344
until tomorrow evening you are not at your own disposal  let it be then the day after tomorrow said aramis	64.0150146484375
alas sir said he i cannot but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you  i certainly am surprised replied m de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese  i had one sir and thank god such as i could wish cried dartagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from me  he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m de tréville	148.88827514648438
but dartagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m bazin and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friends valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five	136.14443969726562
on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides  yes added athos i now ask you dartagnan what side you are on	248.9834442138672
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here  an enemy cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin	118.27423858642578
andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation	147.23719787597656
they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million	206.1336212158203
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second	86.0643539428711
who knows when i shall be at liberty that i may not satisfy your curiosity  and will you make the same promise to my love cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	86.35630798339844
it is miserabledo you seealways to wait till the end of the month  oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting	221.56263732910156
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton	325.46282958984375
in fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of february	104.05110931396484
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship	165.7742919921875
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts	94.12568664550781
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife  port dart 2d february  this is capital said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push on they rode forward and reached abbeville	308.1624450683594
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the  concierges  door and which merits a particular description	235.15931701660156
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past  yes  well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man  extraordinary did you say  yes  you have known him for some time then  scarcely longer than eight or ten days  and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days	173.04722595214844
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion dartagnan to be preparing his exordium	255.0816192626953
the explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared	284.60333251953125
speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the duc de beaufort this officer and i have been on bad terms	90.95211029052734
i thank you dartagnan  you are more impetuous than you were returned dartagnan	83.11285400390625
at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bellpull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation	377.51702880859375
m de morcerf will accompany me  bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six oclock	115.57343292236328
come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature  dantès pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush it	206.0837860107422
by the lord my good host	225.83250427246094
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business	115.41708374023438
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last  i dont know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord	86.3660659790039
you are in constant communication with the baron danglars the count inquired of albert de morcerf	98.39610290527344
how do you take it inquired the unknown in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling	494.37994384765625
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	72.79434204101562
a written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his majesty and the illtreated people have drawn up the following which i have the honor to present to your majesty  and is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman replied tréville haughtily	91.71949768066406
my lord said dartagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible  that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation	250.2749481201172
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé dubuquoi from for levêque of latude from the bastille	100.2685317993164
the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution	156.80308532714844
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment	171.6739501953125
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight  then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch  take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	118.2585678100586
no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it  i  yes you	340.3627014160156
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque headdress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	93.72144317626953
monte cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all	147.44496154785156
matrimonial projects  the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his  coupé  did not appear	112.72215270996094
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception	59.64335250854492
the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that dartagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty  soubrette  perceiving his presence	130.08230590820312
lord winter you are not the king you are my uncle  at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos murmuring he is avenged  think of my mother shouted mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop	129.66188049316406
a terrible inclination seized dartagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained himself	124.3223648071289
dartagnan was worn out with fatigue	48.48676681518555
dartagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love	122.29983520507812
he did not however lose sight of milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face	135.2823944091797
but if he annoys you this young fool  to be sure he does	102.49227905273438
albert in his turn sat behind	345.5385437011719
to join the army under the prince count  and i too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	84.97657012939453
as to myself i shall go around to see athos for though i dont think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said dartagnan	426.9508056640625
but these 200 francs  here they are and 200 more besides	386.0371398925781
he weighed the two angers in his brainthat of the cardinal and that of the queen that of the cardinal predominated enormously	73.14028930664062
i do not jest said athos	8.355791091918945
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess  two years exclaimed dantès do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time  not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned	232.282470703125
richelieu knew that in combating england he combated buckingham that in triumphing over england he triumphed over buckinghamin short that in humiliating england in the eyes of europe he humiliated buckingham in the eyes of the queen	323.76263427734375
what he continued can i have been following a false pathcan the end which i proposed be a mistaken endcan one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking	281.4120788574219
at the sight of dartagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken	87.98611450195312
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux  the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all	177.93170166015625
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled	93.37409210205078
in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror	132.59197998046875
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first	72.68431854248047
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i cannot say that i have seen anything extraordinary	67.69459533691406
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance  alas said kitty for whom have i exposed myself to all that  for me i well know my sweet girl said dartagnan	126.90098571777344
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits	216.29261779785156
but i was going to tell you that i met m de morcerf the other day  well  monsieur franz is his friend you know  what then  monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate return valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate	88.79069519042969
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck	124.50312805175781
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring	141.0745391845703
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window	239.3134307861328
no monsieur replied the young man i will remain with monsieur le comte  adieu then to both my good friends said dartagnan may god preserve you	101.9050064086914
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	395.31500244140625
at eight oclock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition	77.91444396972656
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the halfcurtains closely drawn	133.1658477783203
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest	223.0362548828125
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes	172.70602416992188

a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you  but from whom is that letter  oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding  grisette  from madame de chevreuses chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchesss coronet  what do you say  hold	185.002685546875
he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine and how he had loved her and that valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion	83.60143280029297
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall	161.50160217285156

he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook	152.97105407714844
when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever	116.08736419677734
the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and dartagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss	184.8449249267578
a letter from charles the first	54.4394416809082

oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell him  in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper	94.26762390136719
it follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should  that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults  faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air	206.92767333984375
i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return  oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears	176.15155029296875
the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queens generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure	354.18389892578125
a moment cried dartagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their halfdrawn swords	156.39663696289062
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman  perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine  and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger	128.6216278076172
beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic	231.09185791015625
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent	23.097700119018555
each one went out by the open doors	93.17848205566406

during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	171.62246704101562
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society  of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne	102.78367614746094
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time  these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo	169.04962158203125
one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishingboat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the nevertobeforgotten night of his departure for the château dif he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither	132.30361938476562
you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched  is it then so terrible a poison  oh no	418.14593505859375
père pamphile more wine  and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table	49.85605239868164

take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom	107.39100646972656

i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea	226.8075408935547
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that valentine ran to him saying  oh father some misfortune has happened  your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m de villefort	96.52989959716797
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	268.32830810546875
he watched the effect of this question on the old man	29.660659790039062
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word	86.76876831054688
madame cried mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and me  at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges	225.8961639404297
ah m de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you	37.75178146362305
he saw dartagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once	65.12544250488281
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same	138.34762573242188
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	32.6943244934082

when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously	93.77124786376953

how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason	308.40631103515625
she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth	27.037015914916992
pray let me know who you really are  the stranger smiled a melancholy smile	138.07049560546875
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m de villefort  indeed said m danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care  as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence  what you count said madame danglars signing if you are take care for i shall never forgive you  andrea pricked up his ears	100.706298828125

athos on his part had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion and who was named grimaud	173.29269409179688
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressinggown	93.39836120605469
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world	138.8123016357422
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt	66.016845703125
i wish i had never seen you cried dartagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason	266.4205017089844
greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads  rochefort and dartagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye	154.43016052246094
the abovementioned purchase was made on his highnesss account whose mandate i had for the sum of four hundred thousand francs	82.3865966796875

that monsieur dartagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king	94.22525024414062
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais	117.0558853149414
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone  a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman	225.09500122070312
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him	165.98460388183594
from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them	77.3436508178711
is it not a halt in deaths anteroom  40026m    i am prejudiced against beauchamp said albert drawing franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray	450.0223693847656
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved uselessfor though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months	158.95333862304688
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing	180.24119567871094
accordingly it was admitted to the presence of anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them	229.5449981689453
milady smiled and dartagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile	179.92431640625
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence	84.15766906738281
sir said davrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened	466.6884460449219
the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill edmond hoped he was dying	245.6888885498047
oh my mother exclaimed albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and meyou cannot have made the same resolution i have for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house andand to you  i also replied mercédès am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me have i deceived myself  mother said albert with firmness	160.380859375
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time  but if you yourselves should be struck said athos	160.29959106445312
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people	147.40586853027344

the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door	113.35289764404297
the utility of stovepipes   it was evident that without suspecting it and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection	290.10687255859375
he did not look like an executioner  and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office  but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way	139.8367156982422
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis  add monsieur dartagnan my lord	81.90484619140625
why this very morning in my rooms he made his  entrée  amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting châteaurenaud  and what do you suppose is the counts age inquired mercédès evidently attaching great importance to this question	343.25146484375
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches	121.22050476074219
come murmured athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please  it was three oclock in the afternoon	70.14744567871094
well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king	122.53484344482422
the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse	178.05255126953125
i am glad to see said dartagnan that you have still that honest lad with you  he is my steward replied porthos he will never leave me	93.43373107910156

i cannot stop a moment i must start for paris again immediately  what	147.91232299804688
we lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life	449.5914611816406
for heavens sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshnessfor heavens sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch	185.1672821044922

the affair at armentieres asked he again	103.45841217041016
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason	768.6320190429688
it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing  dartagnan was on the point of telling athos all but one consideration restrained him	271.46044921875
you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between usbut you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take  upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself	232.5391387939453
he was carried home in the arms of the people	23.163841247558594
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do	210.88824462890625
he seemed to be quite overcome	349.0772399902344
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted milady a last time and took his course toward the city	108.7767562866211
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis	89.78697204589844
m de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio	128.51641845703125
very well  until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me	138.4128875732422
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant	65.7949447631836
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos	232.90890502929688
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning	131.25894165039062

the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed they have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal eagerly	106.63229370117188
as little sensitive as was the heart of dartagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance	133.65187072753906
you will take a biscuit with it will you not  yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging  monte cristo rang baptistin appeared	117.35213470458984
but to return to our millions  certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world	89.31895446777344
they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel  now you get angry and attack our poor agents	373.851318359375
had i ten yaninas in my family i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times  as for monte cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless	182.6289825439453
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand	155.66326904296875
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king  be easy said aramis i will take two poniards and give one to parry	202.5872344970703

monsieur porthos cried the procurators wife	17.916017532348633
it is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men	250.5979766845703
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where dartagnan was waiting	111.3832015991211
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood	246.46331787109375

morcerf and châteaurenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission	166.00218200683594
where is he  ill  very ill say you	188.3035430908203
but continued dartagnan you shall judge of him for yourself	94.81436157226562
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation	216.71673583984375
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prizemoney manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall	230.96231079101562
what is life to mevery little without you mother for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name	128.89300537109375

in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchengarden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some marketgardeners at a yearly rental of 500 francs	355.6150817871094
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain	374.7662353515625
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed	114.61892700195312

faith you are indeed right not to return to it	87.43547058105469
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad	116.13758087158203
my lord said dartagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect but i must warn you that we have no time to lose open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities  be assured answered mazarin that i shall attempt nothing i give you my word of honor  dartagnan made a sign to porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to mazarin  now my lord let us enter if you please     chapter lxxxvi	150.32923889160156

lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior	128.8125762939453
dartagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as dartagnan	189.7201690673828
with you dartagnan with you porthosall four reunited for the first time for twenty yearswe would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together  and did you promise the queen resumed dartagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell	165.16139221191406
can this be another vengeance of that woman  it was now athos who turned pale	180.60958862304688

as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	109.35909271240234
madame de saintméran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former	185.5679473876953
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke	169.89254760742188
yes but why dont you come there also  athos colored a little and answered  should i go i shall be delighted to see you there  halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay  then turning to athos he added  i seem to miss something here	169.13766479492188

still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance	137.93988037109375
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow	137.59512329101562
that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery  thats the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	109.69348907470703
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind	198.14830017089844
your power is great i know but you also know that with the help of god men have often conquered the most terrible demons	180.195556640625
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred  it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting	204.9452667236328
but who then is andrea cavalcanti asked danglars in amazement	156.27230834960938
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church	231.44375610351562
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern	489.9493713378906
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord  that is true said his antagonists	253.59173583984375
officer   meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening	310.7464904785156
the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the customhouse officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire	127.9921875
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side  good thought dartagnan in this direction i am satisfied he pressed aramiss hand and went in search of porthos	129.56558227539062
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting	136.77410888671875
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending	150.97735595703125
the mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us  yes but the son has done us no harm  grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands	209.04605102539062

20219m    let us understand each other said albert it is agreedis it notthat you are to be at no	59.386295318603516
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required  i know it said athos coolly since here it is  and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels	155.23129272460938
when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet	140.66539001464844
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners  mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of dartagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said  i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away  no replied dartagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour	225.07342529296875
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business	209.3416290283203
what are you meddling with stupid	154.4722137451172
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain  sure to gain repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count	271.8556823730469
i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very simple  come aramis said dartagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to marie michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the duke of buckingham  mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing	169.15098571777344
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man	31.097347259521484

the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him	153.42739868164062

doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again  dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	115.80181121826172
nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty	54.84217071533203

at length m de tréville himself returned	59.86982345581055
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension	391.9084777832031
this pretended dartagnanwas he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into trévilles house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances	158.40606689453125
oh take ittake it said the count haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know  ali left the room	206.81600952148438

the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the barons countenance would not have led him to suspect it	155.9807586669922
do i look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	140.1377716064453
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men  the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it	156.3988037109375

yes you talk like a childi repeat the word	163.52810668945312
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano	359.9414978027344
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	34.335533142089844
you and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him	87.52682495117188
the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention	309.73638916015625
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	299.29473876953125
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace	193.3616180419922
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god	150.32293701171875
if it were so with m morrel  unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m morrel cannot give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it  how so  he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months	158.51539611816406
had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of  you are right aramis let us travel on  to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible	168.14141845703125
will this be permitted me  certainly replied the officer and left the room	91.99359893798828
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers	333.5006103515625
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject	162.9973907470703
follow him said villefort to dantès	64.9077377319336
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt	229.94528198242188
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as i have given you proofs my dear cousin i am not unskilled in such affairs and i will take charge of the commission	140.39768981933594
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz dépinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of m luigi vampa	122.24456024169922
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawingroom	146.4716796875
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	223.91294860839844
oh i am very presuming i am aware	87.24256134033203
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger  while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow	140.85076904296875
he had stopped like raoul at the hotel of the bell and bottle the best at compiegne and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at noyon	120.67112731933594
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too	243.9412078857422
still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner	188.83343505859375
oh sir he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with provisions  this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety	432.26275634765625
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès	73.94625854492188
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked dartagnan	54.2879638671875
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world	124.1122055053711
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence	96.34573364257812
come he said tis a warning from heaven	127.35520935058594
ah he has a niece interrupted porthos	409.286865234375
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	166.01287841796875
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of the archers	52.59868240356445
count of morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer	115.02167510986328
here i am back again and we are going to be happy  yes yes my boy so we willso we will replied the old man but how shall we be happy	78.50311279296875
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections	355.6946105957031
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner	126.58279418945312
then steer for monte cristo  the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island	58.14501190185547
he had passed and repassed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there	193.9352264404297
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre i shall look like some retired baker	108.53268432617188
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant	231.2932891845703
italy sinbad the sailor chapter 32	190.687255859375
as i am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed i went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it	120.4150619506836
a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst	212.72357177734375
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate	281.6600341796875
it is for me then to interrogate grimaud  where is she asked athos	127.30056762695312
he had tried his strength to the utmost	47.11688232421875
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence  my chaise broke down coming into lilliers  capital  what  capital   yes i want your chaise  and how shall i travel then  on horseback  you talk very comfortablya hundred and eighty leagues  whats that  one can do it	293.4958190917969
oh i am a christian cried dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him	173.31393432617188
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to dartagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak	141.12977600097656
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him	198.07444763183594
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the barons equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle	121.91565704345703
ah my dear fellow excuse me i am lodged like a chartreux	108.65918731689453
it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that dartagnan himself could hardly recognize him	308.5229797363281
it remains now for us to keep our word	63.06524658203125
i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastrets warehouse and at smyrna from pascals that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars  now i recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me  there you see exclaimed danglars	177.04112243652344
the same as yesterday  another nod on the part of grimaud	129.85777282714844
a bright spot burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement	515.160400390625
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going  why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion  but what are we going to do there  you know well that we go to breakfast there  but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot  because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	127.55784606933594
let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you	56.007789611816406
oh this is too much cried milady	24.291532516479492
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed  yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described	379.00054931640625
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable	93.87271118164062
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed  the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm	93.83574676513672
dartagnan you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de trévilles place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey  well i am in a maze said porthos do  you  approve of what dartagnan has done   parbleu  indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it  and now gentlemen said dartagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for allthat is our motto is it not  and yet said porthos	117.2490005493164
this woman passed for his sister	51.28755187988281
why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi	86.7808609008789
cromwell gazed a moment after him	89.35030364990234
m coquenard was served first then porthos	444.1932067871094
what does all this mean asked aramis	125.80427551269531
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself	216.57167053222656
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow  my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women	147.4130401611328

while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could  30059m    dear valentine  well would you believe it	172.0494384765625
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said  i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing  i doubt it planchet replied dartagnan but what are you thinking of  i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested  always cautious planchet  tis instinct your honor  well what does your instinct tell you now  sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in  ah ah said dartagnan planchets recital agreeing with his own observations	197.28903198242188
you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my opinion  aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence	120.43274688720703

high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted  well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain  thats useless said dartagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party  at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held	121.50261688232422

porthos was discontented with his condition	62.380104064941406

the queen smiled but instead of answering  see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame  then turning toward her daughter  what do you want henrietta she demanded	290.12432861328125
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the 4500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champsélysées	204.2610626220703

well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	86.87860870361328
what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger and even this diamondsupposing that dartagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queenhad not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet	113.8634262084961

i could have drunk fifty bottles more  dartagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewildered	292.6325988769531

you give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of  and who has filled your head with all this nonsense  why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly i learned it from beauchamps journal and thirdly from my own imagination	280.86004638671875
mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing returned	258.9681091308594
preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags	313.2198791503906
for a moment dartagnan thought that parrys brother had disappeared but he was mistaken	108.81525421142578
either we shall be attacked or not	237.7262725830078
they went to find porthos and at the corner of the rue bac met mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a horse	77.89898681640625
can you believe so said porthos protruding his lips with contempt	53.56196594238281
your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is porthoss purse too  he put it into his pocket	194.70782470703125
allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment you know that is never refused among neighbors  without waiting for the permission of his host dartagnan went quickly into the house and cast a rapid glance at the bed	116.26203155517578
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes	215.4495849609375
on the contrary i take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman	154.73245239257812
but whither shall we flywhither escape  let us first withdraw from this house afterward we shall see  the young woman and the young man without taking the trouble to shut the door after them descended the rue des fossoyeurs rapidly turned into the rue des fossésmonsieurleprince and did not stop till they came to the place st sulpice	90.93479919433594
but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawingrooms the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young ladys diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly	203.9362030029297
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere	255.576171875
well what have i learned since	248.53424072265625

listen attentively  alas stammered villefort i do not lose a single word  m	84.59968566894531
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat	277.48272705078125
mademoiselle danglars was still the samecold beautiful and satirical	260.4540710449219
no but gaetano did i thought  gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone  and if this person be not a smuggler who is he  a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure  come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree  what is his name  if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name  sinbad the sailor  yes  and where does he reside  on the sea  what country does he come from  i do not know  have you ever seen him  sometimes  what sort of a man is he  your excellency will judge for yourself  where will he receive me  no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of  have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace  oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word  decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure  his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel	217.92916870117188
climb up said he to dantès	94.14459228515625
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained	188.58139038085938
de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment	161.2914276123047
do you think they will grant it  without doubt  how many are they  four and the two bandits make six  just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to monte cristo  yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions  by all means be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses i do more than permit i exhort you  silence then said gaetano	195.3757781982422
the queen saving us her friends nothing more moral	227.01409912109375
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct	159.85076904296875
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless	531.8340454101562
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husbands father  yes madame m de villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis i think  alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	192.83706665039062
you refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment	47.09916687011719
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waitingmaid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment	100.33683776855469
on your return you cannot make a mistake	55.46529769897461
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine	141.9552764892578
it appears there is something fresh aboard  aramis said athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the parpaillot i believe  yes  how did you fare  for my part i ate but little	128.7042694091797
coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks	317.15704345703125
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action	134.25540161132812
edmond and mercédès were clasped in each others arms	281.2520446777344
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire	255.65440368652344
monsieur said mademoiselle daubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voitures friends	134.78793334960938
the queen was still standing when he entered but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here  to make madame in the name of the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers  how monsieur an investigation of my papersmine	135.7592315673828
as to that we know dartagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle	124.9515609741211
dartagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces	39.65849685668945
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay	161.28411865234375
but i must see him instantly  take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother  you have kept the secret	190.34567260742188
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him	103.45159912109375
the foundations business office is located at 809 north 1500 west salt lake city ut 84116 801 5961887	84.59658813476562
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat	99.70057678222656
i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men  ah	153.02276611328125
speak comte de la fere  my lord replied athos for myself i have nothing to demand	34.97014236450195
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also  monte cristo gently smiled and saidi was there at the same time pointing to the corner of a street	252.97686767578125
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the  trousseau  of the brideelect was on exhibition	121.7127685546875
who was it you were talking with over there she asked	244.01544189453125
another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me  a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbés speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards	172.28341674804688
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story  what else have you done  after having lost my own horse nine against tensee how neari formed an idea of staking yours  yes but you stopped at the idea i hope  no for i put it in execution that very minute  and the consequence said dartagnan in great anxiety	191.35118103027344
the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus	228.23179626464844
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants	270.7344970703125
his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers	86.7279052734375
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which dartagnan is blindly governed	320.8313293457031
what have i said  you said that porthos had received a sword cut  yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so  and why so  zounds monsieur	158.33627319335938
fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a bankers wife whatever might be my confidence in my husbands good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk	214.91653442382812
morbleu  monsieur said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you  perhaps said athos	95.93702697753906
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived	68.91355895996094
no replied morcerf my father is most anxious about it and i hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothedmademoiselle eugénie danglars  eugénie danglars said monte cristo tell me is not her father baron danglars  yes returned morcerf a baron of a new creation  what matter said monte cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction  enormous ones answered beauchamp	199.86578369140625
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave dartagnan uneasiness	266.4950866699219
lord winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two	118.03985595703125
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows  gentlemen	436.166015625
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling	520.5808715820312
the sudden extinction of the  moccoletti  the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness	113.58365631103516
be on the qui vive cried dartagnan	39.513153076171875
that mood lasted some time but now hes as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing  and du vallon asked athos	421.34271240234375
the drop of water  chapter lxiv	28.55413818359375
i confess it but pardon to every sin	401.3555603027344
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters	380.0066833496094
we are safe on that side said buckingham turning toward dartagnan	120.82676696777344
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave	362.2810363769531
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom	164.92364501953125
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm	421.4439697265625
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you  yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor	129.37173461914062
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor	69.42091369628906
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but dartagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams	202.7714385986328
there what do you think now of the affair	43.14005661010742
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment	74.64443969726562
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinals cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation	84.51905059814453
they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than theythat of a conference	143.29571533203125
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that dartagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	203.6839141845703
the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte daix	289.9738464355469
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours  which you please monsieur said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven  thirtyfive minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you  and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	194.47586059570312
well asked the duke when they were alone	73.87228393554688
the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth	362.3441162109375
he has he is an abbé  ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan	218.97488403320312
these cannot be for us said athos	36.5601806640625
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinals	91.64015197753906
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	252.083740234375
they directed their horses to the city	42.38286209106445
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt	91.5107192993164
and now farewell  farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror	457.90155029296875
as for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation	345.4878234863281
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder	159.94729614257812
16 the god of fruitfulness in grecian mythology	256.52703857421875
scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the kings attorney	162.91348266601562
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them	91.8560562133789
it is you bernouin she said	66.93050384521484

thomson  french said he do you know this house monsieur  20253m    they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly	118.80159759521484

speak  he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guardsan appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers  tis the appointment monsieur de tréville held you ask of me  the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de tréville has left it it has not been filled  but it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings household  monsieur de tréville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years  you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed	167.38450622558594
dartagnan believed this cough to be a signal	51.54001235961914
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause	223.8238067626953
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance	152.7016143798828
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakenedif conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist if a conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of courage	347.8786926269531

our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing	288.9849548339844
then why did you smile  why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine  do you want me to go away  ah no no	143.6676483154297
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter	149.38778686523438
we therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul  certainly sir replied the viscount	288.3802490234375
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape dartagnan appeared to authorize the issue	216.93673706054688
dartagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris	60.73268127441406
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m de villefort even would not have alarmed him	145.13819885253906
the morrel family  in a very few minutes the count reached no	105.96798706054688
hence it resulted when dartagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard	175.80918884277344
i have not failed to do so your reverences replied the young man returning their salutation	67.18598937988281
theyre after me was andreas first thought	568.2612915039062

well my dear mouston he said rest satisfied	430.7701416015625
think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome and you reply i do not know and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son	126.3371353149414
what is the matter my lord said athos and what puts you out of breath thus  nothing replied de winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round	162.25335693359375
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him	132.1873321533203
am i not right m de châteaurenaud  40252m    that is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn  thank you gentlemen replied albert with a smile of indifference i shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france	168.59222412109375
then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required athos would no more give him his handathos would renounce him	189.1314239501953
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	129.16648864746094
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea	78.37847900390625
yes my lord it is i i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly  and dartagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking	118.47021484375
he is not curious thought dartagnan	140.14004516601562
let us not talk about money if you please it is humiliating  then you no longer love me said the procurators wife slowly and sadly	127.86207580566406
you said only imagineand then paused	306.04205322265625
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehendwe have been guided by an invisible handa hand as powerful as that of an enchanter  oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched	174.64344787597656
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should rally  i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve  you serve the cardinal  yes madame and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart	102.37886047363281
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	67.83185577392578
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll	293.6637878417969
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol	75.69355773925781
you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them	566.3741455078125
while i watched the window he guarded the door  good said athos	96.12051391601562
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	185.98129272460938
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house	86.8029556274414
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take this	121.47325134277344
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole  monsieur dartagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	201.26072692871094
yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you are  wretch cried dartagnan speak quickly	260.31524658203125
dartagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m de tréville grasped the situation	124.86710357666016
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent	183.080810546875
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it  but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me  30101m    this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	124.1424560546875
her very self she gave it me last night	290.4677429199219
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket  yes said dartagnan athos is right it must be burned	122.04536437988281
it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent	124.65483856201172
besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair	207.25819396972656
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect	167.43544006347656
what more could the most devoted lover desire then he murmured the words of the english poet frailty thy name is woman  six months afterwards continued caderousse the marriage took place in the church of accoules  the very church in which she was to have married edmond murmured the priest there was only a change of bridegrooms  well mercédès was married proceeded caderousse but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart	213.13690185546875
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me	117.00176239013672
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly  well asked dartagnan	158.9348602294922
ha ha ha and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle	269.1606140136719
i will not make a confidant of him  alas said valentine i see that i have given you pain	87.41583251953125
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother	162.4268341064453

he was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols	127.06271362304688

the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty	215.51504516601562
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent	208.54049682617188

you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost	72.6693115234375
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug	150.3022918701172
you look careworn really you alarm me	146.99105834960938

good lord how cold i am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door	89.12567138671875

the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans heart	152.38600158691406
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms	156.30471801757812
those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with terror	245.79995727539062
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue	284.89892578125
at least keep him there till my daughter be married  impossible madame justice has its formalities  what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest	447.4320983886719
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father  the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	112.49266815185547
all this was answered by an expression of dartagnans	17.642953872680664
she returned to louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall	58.92923355102539
the door immediately closed and dartagnan found himself again in complete obscurity	224.81771850585938
i have during those fiveandtwenty years spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms  sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure	205.97454833984375
no replied athos with a singular smile	21.176185607910156
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid	212.108642578125
they must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to armentièreseach by a different route	76.74000549316406
they disobeyed orders  i beg of your majesty then said athos calmly and not replying to mazarin to quash these arrests of messieurs dartagnan and du vallon  what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the queen	155.8432159423828
my wife and my daughter would die of it	96.41742706298828
we are about to have the honor of charging you replied aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other	72.58221435546875
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pashas misfortunes  who then urged you to write	190.4444580078125
in this garden mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twentyfour years previously	157.23277282714844
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	37.23890686035156
dartagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated	170.77964782714844
when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti  yes said morrel smiling it was the 5th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some  20237m    heroic action interrupted châteaurenaud	150.9541778564453
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural   ma foi  said châteaurenaud i would rather end my career like m de morcerf a pistolshot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe  and moreover it kills said beauchamp	272.4113464355469
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning	591.8663330078125
one evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever	184.08067321777344
look fernand your eyes are better than mine	130.13894653320312
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment  nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded	177.30191040039062
first you purchase a house at auteuilthis house is the one where i have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child	140.410400390625
the cardinal therefore rose to open it	50.3598747253418
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts	67.04427337646484
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her	203.7761993408203
is the baroness at home inquired danglars	145.04666137695312
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said	151.07896423339844
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal	79.02884674072266
necessity has no law besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least	174.2086181640625
oh m davrigny i beseech you do something for her  where is she  in her room with the notary  and m noirtier  just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking  and the same love for youeh my dear child  yes said valentine he was very fond of me  who does not love you valentine smiled sadly	102.97612762451172
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other	206.93814086914062
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never	1199.9635009765625
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even feel	127.33177185058594
thats a match you are playing with his eminence this letter is your game	227.01344299316406
reflect that i am your wife  you are a poisoner  in the name of heaven  no  in the name of the love you once bore me  no no  in the name of our child	79.81820678710938
i thought i had been deceivedhad mistaken the spot	224.61734008789062
we must understand each other said the duke	21.6617374420166
he likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	37.27947998046875
dartagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him	124.4655532836914
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart	139.73666381835938
dartagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but dartagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it	120.2038345336914
yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards	99.86985778808594
tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier though  my friend urban grandier wasnt a sorcerer he was a learned man	572.069091796875
anne of austria sought to read in mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired	221.31239318847656
never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers neck	160.36907958984375
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin	243.1634521484375
yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet	118.03174591064453
dartagnan remained standing and examined this man	144.73223876953125
you would follow the escort exclaimed porthos in dismay	240.99623107910156
the telegraph  m and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them there	53.56362533569336
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry	109.00121307373047
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night	161.600830078125
yes you were thinking of it and with justice	73.60786437988281
i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you  and who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration	118.95691680908203
at last said aramis we are ready are we  yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the  because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	253.01715087890625
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but god  it is possible  have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play  certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time  well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society  aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment	259.1472473144531
my brother continued she was not that my lord buckingham whom i saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived  himself	94.40387725830078
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion	122.39060974121094
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us	108.21600341796875
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated	255.5045166015625
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid allwere it my life  oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments i also have had dreams	232.68710327148438
at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easychair	137.23251342773438
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door	62.2340202331543
good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation  why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly	76.43750762939453
do not be alarmed m noirtier said davrigny i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness  and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade	146.95559692382812
the standard  very well in half an hour we shall be on board  and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england  what do you say of that young man asked dartagnan as they hurried along	101.16830444335938
de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family  if such be the case my dear valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence	198.42835998535156
to nobody in the world  not even to athos or porthos  i have not breathed a syllable to them  good enough  tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with dartagnan and both soon arrived at athoss dwelling	212.77235412597656
would you like me to send edward to you for a short time  it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven	172.41053771972656
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	185.66415405273438
but you sent for me my dear child	20.514686584472656
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt	132.23178100585938
we shall see returned the other smiling	130.00274658203125
has not your excellency heard that the french  chargé daffaires  was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri  oh yes i heard that  well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at portoferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered	239.77101135253906
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips	84.86380767822266
he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow	119.78150939941406
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	237.64739990234375
to saint peters first and then to the colosseum returned albert	153.35885620117188
gendarmes said the president lead in the accused  at these words the public attention became more intense and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter	193.42645263671875
let us leave them she said	94.48880767822266
before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there	858.573974609375
goodday m morrel said he as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from aix or toulon	145.9806671142578
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart	216.51840209960938
he left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for pontoise	79.77783966064453
how should i know what a horse is	134.47369384765625
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on youon them depended my fathers life replied she	213.02340698242188
how could i then return to brussels	126.22151947021484
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends	94.25019073486328
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but i cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault	177.1692352294922

another flash illuminated all around them	172.22459411621094

but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	205.9237823486328
now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a womans weakness there are twelve days  well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations  yes sire	298.468017578125
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier	128.89767456054688
oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence	326.32904052734375
dartagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat	75.54057312011719
you understandno more delay  yes sir i will give my attention to the subject  i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	79.08927917480469
this modern place of entertainment stood on the lefthand side of the post road and backed upon the rhône	173.08815002441406
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos	117.02876281738281
thou must add said dartagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name  planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servantman with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself	126.15953826904297
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair  do you really think so	130.60470581054688
pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing  but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces  dont be afraid	165.83721923828125
there said the young man handing kitty the letter sealed give that to milady	373.2442932128906
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed	471.64501953125
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same	103.97423553466797
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind  oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you  no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to  six millions gasped danglarsso be it  then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned	219.40896606445312
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage	227.78614807128906
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos	285.6380615234375
it does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started it does not signify gentlemen	181.0281982421875
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the goldembroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable	269.1521301269531
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldricin ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous	186.1082305908203
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other  i dont say exactly answered the gascon confused	89.7348403930664
yes the rolling of a carriage  it is the one my brother sends for us  oh my god  come come	156.00070190429688
if you have it use it replied gondy	69.14366912841797
albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner	106.89727783203125
it was a mixed mass of blue red and gold	99.82164001464844
but you my friendare you not going to change your dress  no i shall go as i am	86.53871154785156
i am lord de winter brotherinlaw of that  woman   the three friends uttered a cry of surprise	44.905731201171875
in fact about four oclock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance	197.64544677734375
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested dartagnans permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon	111.2935791015625
ah what is that cried the brigadier	63.87043380737305
gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through	138.08775329589844
i am mistaken  monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him  no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me	64.3919448852539
i have warned m danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese	80.14990997314453
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey	141.89694213867188
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to delbeuf	196.00611877441406
but still we have quite lost our dear eugénie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france  still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire	276.4336242675781
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek one is i believe from phædrus and the other from bias	188.89952087402344
yes returned dartagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the king  dartagnan said athos this is no joke i trust	176.0235137939453
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee	92.66949462890625
in what a tone you speak cried valentine	101.14732360839844
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach	63.05995178222656
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground	138.23361206054688
de bernet were exiled and laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant	107.28787994384766
he sends me for that purpose and here i am  the poor womans head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees	113.5596694946289
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	199.3480987548828
monsieur continued she turning to monte cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us  believe me madame i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know this is but a trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated  we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that  monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent	138.348876953125
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheardof that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs	192.8574676513672
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions	134.56478881835938
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sicklylooking	223.2290496826172
m danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry	205.27212524414062
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port	207.398681640625
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me  a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	144.8686065673828
give the watchword  do you want money  money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more rapidly  gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag	263.70361328125
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of sanfelices steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in earrings necklaces and gold hairpins	247.4490509033203
dead on the scaffold condemned by parliament  impossible  and executed in our presence  what then has monsieur de flamarens been telling me  monsieur de flamarens  yes he has just gone out  athos smiled	163.02569580078125
in fact the rochellais had made a  sortie  during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before	122.45382690429688
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours	187.9408721923828
this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed	101.54717254638672
then i should like to have three sons i should make the first a nobleman like athos the second a good soldier like porthos the third an excellent abbé like aramis	266.1788330078125
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other	77.51411437988281
dartagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop	174.02462768554688
mine was carried away by a ball	29.88787269592285
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercers wife he did not forget his friends	158.1066131591797
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beatthe child was dead	163.33375549316406
the same evening andrea was incarcerated in the conciergerie	62.05498123168945
what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers  he had scarcely finished when dartagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time	171.0915985107422
were you present during the last struggle asked m davrigny	148.67742919921875
i was saying it was very interesting  what was  all you were showing me	104.99818420410156
i endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold	245.17359924316406
what can i say more asked monte cristo	51.91741943359375
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered	114.9219970703125
i am nearly thirtyseven  mind aramisdartagnan smiled as he spokesince we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future  how  formerly i was your junior by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old  indeed	236.69515991210938
ah said milady listening in her turn to the noise of feltons steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter at length you are mine  then her brow darkened	94.36683654785156
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly	488.1779479980469
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule dartagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain lauxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy	66.07413482666016
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrinis hotel	147.0429229736328
my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability  morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz	174.69566345214844
you are pale and agitated  sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor  to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly	106.13642883300781
you will know that tomorrow evening said the coadjutor smiling	88.97297668457031
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie	156.36778259277344
a circle was immediately formed around the door	103.52438354492188
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert  i replied the viscounti saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern  besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything	150.77577209472656
and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me  if my society would not be disagreeable  be it so	155.31561279296875
i know not why but i feel that this crime  you acknowledge then the existence of the crime  yes i see too plainly that it does exist	111.85892486572266
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table	64.41654205322266
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six oclock in the morning	61.729957580566406
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them	122.00108337402344
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak	28.9527587890625
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	204.47720336914062
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living	300.9754943847656
not at all i assure you  but where will you manage to stow me  in the chamber overhead  surely that is where you yourselves sleep  never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room  caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment	213.26031494140625
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel  sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse  morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment	112.9310073852539
excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity funda deposit which i promised to pay this morning  oh well then said monte cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minutes delay it would have been remarkable	144.99099731445312
well where is he sir asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice	204.43128967285156
all is over  but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king  an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss  did you not see his face asked athos	206.91525268554688
your highnesss most devoted servant  in the bastile as elsewhere  comte de rochefort  the duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster	180.74415588378906
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption	371.6935729980469
see see said the young girl	14.36231517791748
at this moment comminges rushed into the room	28.477293014526367
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentines absence had done	1398.535400390625
am i mistaken then said monte cristo	8.15373706817627
in the antechamber upon long circular benches reposed the elect that is to say those who were called	288.2255859375
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself  the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor	62.534019470214844
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others	41.7846565246582
slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject	97.47361755371094
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him	21.825502395629883
the duke porthos and dartagnan roared out both at once	156.12445068359375
by degrees milady became more communicative	130.0715789794922
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door  wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door	193.86727905273438
come back as ambassador come back as minister come back surrounded with guards who will defend you with servants who will watch over you and then i shall no longer fear for your days and i shall be happy in seeing you  oh is this true what you say  yes  oh then some pledge of your indulgence some object which came from you and may remind me that i have not been dreaming something you have worn and that i may wear in my turna ring a necklace a chain  will you departwill you depart if i give you that you demand  yes  this very instant  yes  you will leave france you will return to england  i will i swear to you  wait then wait  anne of austria reentered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding a rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with gold	145.66055297851562
in the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was exposed	217.6160888671875
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward	293.0283203125
the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever  but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fishpond  ah that is where the art comes in	212.6293487548828
dartagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head	67.49504852294922
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber	79.15315246582031
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done	98.02445220947266
i have blessed you and you are sacred to me	51.66050720214844
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect confidence in him	100.44905090332031
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee	294.01617431640625
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as dartagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but dartagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line	169.4503173828125
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	638.95654296875
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss  and she took two or three steps forward	199.30943298339844
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé	83.08658599853516
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution  ah said athos how much time we have lost  now said the king give the word and let us start  will you not give it sire asked athos	112.66041564941406
i have looked at it with all possible attention said dantès and i only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink  this paper my friend said faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to you  the sweat started forth on dantès brow	207.88909912109375
four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room	65.42723846435547
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france  take care athos cried dartagnan dont you see they are aiming  yes yes said athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me  in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him	154.54293823242188
what is the matter then with this dear child	183.0321044921875
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing  it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	114.64641571044922
finish mouston finish the work cried porthos	147.71969604492188
so then said he the letter was true to the end  did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo  no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all  ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript  yes yes repeated the major yesthereisapostscript  in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for 2000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48000 francs which you still owe me  the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	170.3683319091797
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head	89.80259704589844
yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon	130.0462188720703
as luigi spoke thus he left her	64.81885528564453
i took the mule and the horse for what he owed us he assured me that they were two noble steeds  well madame said porthos if he owed you more than five crowns your horsedealer is a thief  there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap monsieur porthos said the procurators wife seeking to excuse herself	151.1065673828125
it was mercédès leaning on her sons arm and leaving the house	75.70427703857422
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am  then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur	158.63992309570312
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly	104.98686981201172
yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majestys wishes  charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king	318.6141662597656
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent	59.86930847167969
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine	203.5620574951172
the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill	293.9634704589844
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her	155.66319274902344
dartagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them	450.3370666503906
a few minutes after twelve oclock bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door having come by the cardinals secret corridor	332.33428955078125

you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the  pharaon   is it possible you were so kind  yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you  and what was his reply  that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also  the hypocrite murmured danglars	209.2650604248047

gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats  yes your excellency and it is true  i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat  your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome	224.40322875976562

what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it	143.61244201660156
at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the  mandaïa  a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper	164.93466186523438
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which dartagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window	162.35952758789062
try porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows	97.58262634277344
i wish to see everything  if your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied dartagnan	160.39906311035156
consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz dépinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever i please  what said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech	204.81092834472656
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raouls way of riding and observed  take care raoul	298.4691467285156

the world is a sepulcher  alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a sigh	59.48866653442383
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die  oh i entreat you exclaimed morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count do not prolong my punishment  the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the château dif	130.6809539794922
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour	102.3243408203125
whither does your excellency desire to be driven  to the residence of baron danglars rue de la chaussée dantin  this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriagedrive	114.25637817382812
the three friends burst into laughter	48.472354888916016
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back	227.71533203125
pardieu  if we may believe the signs grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people	171.34190368652344
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow by confessing all he might prove his good will	178.4997100830078
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm  the doctors niece  hold your tongue porthos said athos you are insupportable  will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise  he took you for buckingham cried dartagnan	171.60699462890625
today the third will be there also  as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days they will get out  yes if your majesty releases them  ah exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris  why so  on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure  madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain paris with paris the bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein  anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand	260.3994445800781
my first visit was to the thicket	49.40089797973633
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie  be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious man	121.69332122802734
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears	296.98162841796875
go  oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness	195.8533477783203
this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels	189.97544860839844
and what makes me all the more wretched sir is that i was the cause of this misfortune  how so asked athos	96.09384155273438
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life	184.8867950439453
i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure  then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuels hand significantly watch over him  why so asked the young man surprised	160.33827209472656
it is there you are to take up your quarters  then in these trunks  i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to needyour plain clothes and your uniform	135.34291076660156
anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness	71.5609359741211
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so	159.21876525878906
valentine uttered a cry of horror morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger	174.76632690429688
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn	200.7152099609375
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder	163.0603790283203
excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment  what for philip asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance	197.7049102783203
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft  the duke had already begun to descend	157.47152709960938
the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing	502.6930236816406
dartagnan and porthos went on meantime to paris	94.03784942626953
the officer desired to have miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat	120.40288543701172
this was too much for the procurators wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and porthos	183.04344177246094
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where dartagnan was confined	172.50413513183594
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it  is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort	282.2872619628906
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance	589.66650390625
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door	107.31970977783203
at the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone  hush smiling as he uttered the word	167.4935760498047
the bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field the boats moored in the loire even became alive and vocal	406.51617431640625
this is what i propose to do said athos	31.465211868286133
non inutile desiderium oblatione   go to the devil with your latin	188.8351287841797
this thoughtthe house of morrel is about to stop paymentbent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done	159.83810424804688
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself	173.40618896484375
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain	129.08575439453125
of bethunenot been there i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it	154.7548828125
but here is m dandré himself and m dandré announced by the chamberlaininwaiting entered	85.0756607055664
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations	201.25399780273438
40298m    yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me	307.0469665527344
you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand	209.4405517578125
people die very suddenly in your house m de villefort  what cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea  still sir and i shall always do so replied davrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m de villefort  the magistrate trembled convulsively	97.70307159423828
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	167.52935791015625
you will return after three or four years with a russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago  thank you my dear beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it cannot be	178.76547241210938
besides which the musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter first	220.25477600097656
oh you are an angel exclaimed the young man	28.406126022338867
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths	239.19775390625
she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grassplot where she fainted	171.80545043945312
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone  tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness	142.15069580078125
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man	8.10000228881836
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them  is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness  they do indeed	241.66563415527344
yet stammered dantès wiping the perspiration from his browyet i gave you two hundred francs when i left three months ago  yes yes edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor caderousse	80.92437744140625
he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven oclock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the hôtel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood	135.22659301757812
save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself	105.71654510498047
upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair	137.52565002441406
listen my dear friend in two words you will know all	99.2554931640625
from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance	107.52177429199219
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate	144.93832397460938
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed  ah if there were no sentinel  there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations	236.39208984375
it was written and signed by albert	163.47866821289062
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect	89.77168273925781
one fine morning the king commanded m de chevalier dessessart to admit dartagnan as a cadet in his company of guards	116.45333862304688
now sir said the count you are safecalm yourself  ah	45.61520004272461
be assured you will not find her majesty ungrateful  oh i am already grandly recompensed cried dartagnan	276.8360595703125
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	177.69879150390625
when dartagnan had finished he said hum	649.0375366210938
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel	170.24993896484375
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that	145.57374572753906
duc dharcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldnt look for us where we were	292.4336853027344
what are you eating there porthos  i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine do the same  you are right	100.69712829589844
i am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard  i am listening madame with the greatest interest said mazarin	407.5622863769531
come come madame cried dartagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous	123.50914764404297
but apropos you belong to the fronde do you not  madame i serve the king  yes in your own way  my way is the way of all gentlemen and i know only one way answered athos haughtily	95.9351577758789
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle	195.03688049316406
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hairthose three marks of race	155.1952362060547
on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger	138.35508728027344
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn	219.1178741455078
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out goodbye mercédèswe shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas	230.2470245361328
he will arrange everything for me	26.733699798583984
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me  shall you not go with the queen  no replied mazarin	109.44385528564453
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes  morrel  yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied	154.45262145996094
this child has caused me to recover what i had lost	54.872562408447266
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost  to die whilst doing a good deed	138.79721069335938
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m de morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you	211.1011505126953
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	228.44073486328125
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron dépinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	142.35140991210938
and you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here  yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company	81.30543518066406
he is going to turn his house into a  badhaus  as the germans term it	160.26918029785156
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance  two soldiers said dartagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window  that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out  finelooking men upon my word said dartagnan	171.2796630859375
no you do all this not i  still it seems to me that as you profit by it  danglars shrugged his shoulders	86.20975494384766
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please	113.07083892822266

this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure	101.4180679321289
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured  oh valentine  the counts heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young mans shoulder said  i was looking for you my friend monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly  you see i was praying the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot	219.2454833984375

there was no answer and she continued  i have not seen you all day	96.89532470703125
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100000 francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in parisamongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just nowit was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place	163.48289489746094

from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of teresa and had sworn she should be his	108.90858459472656
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements	187.0728759765625
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed	115.6490707397461
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him	89.50748443603516
let us talk of something else said he	56.86290740966797
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the dust	71.47063446044922
there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu  the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore	135.80728149414062
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers  oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis	299.13397216796875
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished	123.92906188964844
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling	331.493896484375
he would have spoken but his voice failed him	130.84194946289062
there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart	250.7203826904297
now said the count let us follow him  franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley	81.89238739013672
the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de condé with the princess and dowager princess	72.97095489501953
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence dartagnan went straight to the residence of athos	91.39524841308594
it is not i who strike m de morcerf it is providence which punishes him  and why do you represent providence cried mercédès	202.58607482910156
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges  that is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt  and he threw the money into the river	122.40023803710938
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do	77.2386474609375
the abbé busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future	155.63565063476562
30339m    the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamoretree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain	134.126220703125
very little except long live cromwell  where were you placed  mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything	336.5753173828125
and still further it is very probable i should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours  yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person it is  my lord i have not named her interrupted the young man warmly	82.51012420654297
he spoke in a voice of the procureurgeneral with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law	134.56927490234375
ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice but how pale you are	350.3648376464844
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me  come now said athos you are joking  in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said  i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements  no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences  poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal  come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair  perhaps you speak the truth aramis  well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with dartagnan porthos and possibly even raoul	138.84771728515625
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable	65.6759262084961
we must ask the comte de la fere the question	19.306941986083984
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain	479.6353454589844
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations	255.67684936523438
and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydées apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son  haydée said morrel what has become of her  she departed last night  to leave you  to wait for me	172.45388793945312
i have brought away ten or twelve wounded	280.2447814941406
but methinks i need wine and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary glass	202.9303741455078
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valetdechambre called out  make ready  at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out  la bruyere and du barthois	141.13131713867188
ah you fellows are good managers	330.8705749511719

then i forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the light	74.68687438964844
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass	145.63450622558594
they set out after a run of two leagues mousquetons horse sank	408.1270751953125
a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m noirtiers room	211.5537109375
oh said athos oh no it is impossible	29.92677116394043
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but today is not the proper time today flatter and caress or you are only a common woman  at the first words of this address dartagnan had seized porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force	271.72503662109375
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m de boville the inspector of prisons no	73.05451202392578
speak if you please said mazarin	26.28925323486328
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will  he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling	158.2049560546875
well yes pretty well replied dartagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere  yes that is inevitable said porthos	203.59613037109375
he is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	274.8111267089844
i am doing what is right  the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with dartagnan	108.37298583984375
the presentation  when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as  cicerone  by showing you a specimen of a bachelors apartment	169.7922821044922
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity	232.0477752685547
but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor  the young man is better said danglars	142.08828735351562
the history of athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong	200.12936401367188
she had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman	251.3646240234375
the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass	110.61968994140625
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents  it is true murmured the englishman then you have but one hope  but one  the last  the last  so that if this fail  i am ruinedcompletely ruined  as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port  i know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship  and it is not yours  no she is a bordeaux vessel  la gironde  she comes from india also but she is not mine  perhaps she has spoken to the  pharaon  and brings you some tidings of her  shall i tell you plainly one thing sir	178.05307006835938
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune	215.63807678222656
the cemetery of pèrelachaise  m de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth	167.13710021972656
i dont know what it was	49.21339416503906
if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardonable  the procurators wife was piqued	197.1238250732422
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated	96.53105163574219
fortunately you wont be laid up more than a fortnight	129.53704833984375
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it	309.223876953125
just god he muttered whence comes this thought	774.9120483398438
what will it signify if one two or three more are added	292.7904357910156
when you come to paris i will return all this  i will not refuse i intend going there soon and since you allow me i will pay you a visit	103.09856414794922
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound	392.2006530761719
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	102.38261413574219
remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors	1084.151611328125
come aramis  and we porthos said dartagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal  and tell him cried a voice that i am not too old yet for a man of action  dartagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort	138.4676055908203
you cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father  20299m    we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him	183.38792419433594
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people	149.03097534179688
no more than a drop of water in the ocean  remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow  how so inquired the abbé	237.306884765625
you are the directors of all consciences	58.58369827270508
a few dingy olives and stunted figtrees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict	1030.4288330078125
at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder	127.07786560058594
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	127.71833038330078
they made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling prison	126.43609619140625
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrinis side	67.3895034790039
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton	194.61843872070312
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon	201.23817443847656
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown  i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered	165.50244140625
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open dartagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid	220.6045684814453
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself	122.91363525390625
nevertheless at eight oclock in the morning the regiment of the queens guards commanded by guitant under whom was his nephew comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the palais royal as far as notre dame a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms	282.02032470703125
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting	106.58019256591797
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp	90.00300598144531
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier  and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene	148.02767944335938
the husband heard of the affair on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible animals  which you are taking back to him said dartagnan	144.24644470214844
excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend	44.382362365722656

but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake  what happened during the night asked beauchamp of châteaurenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here  in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron	287.30267333984375
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets	226.63565063476562
dartagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it	219.77061462402344
what is it  i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars  on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him  i am glad to be reassured on that point	114.75531768798828
ah that would indeed be infamous  how did danglars usually write  in a handsome running hand  and how was the anonymous letter written  backhanded  again the abbé smiled	696.0487060546875
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom	175.64419555664062

albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness	89.90654754638672
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party  and what is the origin of this name  it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slingingqui frondentstones from the moats round paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned	297.2371826171875
and he is very rich  i am not so sure of that  and yet you said he had money  fifty thousand livresa mere trifle  he is well educated  hem said monte cristo in his turn	110.64126586914062
the spaniards  that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation	221.53021240234375
he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him	395.7325744628906
andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the  cheval rouge  but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues	142.95086669921875
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right	88.84596252441406
but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	171.52117919921875
ah  pardieu  continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity  monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange	144.02369689941406
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work  i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle and when i was removed to the château dif i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my work here  and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed  oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again  with what  with this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed dantès a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it	155.70423889160156
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are illdisposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard  broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second	120.9999008178711
everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room	55.98258590698242
at neufchâtel as at st valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him	139.14443969726562
speak  tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught theres every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to behung  true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest  now resumed grimaud ive only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest me  ill try said the duke	266.2960205078125
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams	341.574462890625
morcerfs courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow	247.89002990722656

suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed	422.5498962402344
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain	295.0216979980469
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean  he went to find aramis	161.3815155029297
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knowsdartagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant	152.37176513671875
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said	46.78184509277344
however he remained standing clinging to a window	132.62506103515625
i own that this woman terrifies me  shall you have the courage said athos	90.83270263671875
who should it be but he who watches while i sleep who labors while i amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroadin france as in europe  your majesty probably refers to god said m de tréville for i know no one except god who can be so far above your majesty  no monsieur i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only friendof the cardinal  his eminence is not his holiness sire  what do you mean by that monsieur  that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals  you mean to say that he deceives me you mean to say that he betrays me	160.7760467529297

well captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again twice	196.1448516845703
0283m    to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure	164.78567504882812
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newtons system	208.69667053222656
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour	91.79133605957031
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily  do you know the woman who has just entered that box  yes what do you think of her  oh she is perfectly lovelywhat a complexion	196.17254638671875
behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with waxlights	495.3147888183594
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the  âme damnée  of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like a ninny as he is  a ninny indeed said porthos but is the matter certain  i had it from aramis replied the musketeer	170.22874450683594
he awaited mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present situation	291.80059814453125
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him	112.18154907226562
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head	437.69610595703125
if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos	194.55015563964844

after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the othersa proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president moléwhilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes	463.79180908203125
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my fathers faith	147.4786376953125
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended	158.5101776123047
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison  no my lord but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted  and what was it  that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes  you believe in sorcerers then you fool  ii mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my lord giulio who cares about them as an italian he is superstitious  the duke shrugged his shoulders	200.2886199951172
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love  the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks	148.89218139648438
they looked for m danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence	157.8916015625
bonacieux and your regiment your captain  by my soul you had made me forget all that dear constance	212.74832153320312
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall	80.87677764892578
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile	148.45880126953125

it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristos name announced	190.4690704345703
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz  ah indeed  so franz must wait	413.1291809082031

i learned it since i have been in prison and that from the conversation of monsieur the commissaryan amiable man  the cardinal repressed another smile	87.4277572631836
give me the despatch raoul  the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct	140.731201171875
mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to be	528.4688110351562
they are binding her they are going to drag her away cried dartagnan to himself springing up from the floor	120.38050079345703
a captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family	153.80221557617188
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line	238.99972534179688
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him	160.49371337890625
swear first on your honor not to inform him of our return  conditions  why not  because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlemen  then let us draw on the spot	172.3333740234375

albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it	162.8146209716797
yes see i send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a letter	205.00811767578125

in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind	91.90731048583984
on the contrary that simplifies the matter greatly	346.5653991699219
30123m    so sir you lived at lucca did you	497.6234130859375
if m danglars will not fight with me i will kill his soninlaw cavalcanti will certainly fight  the servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted	174.2442626953125
no monsieur le comte answered the servant i think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes	106.3039779663086
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness  milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else	169.92413330078125

milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward	273.8716125488281
m and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	169.4403839111328
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities  no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found  well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france  yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination  were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known  no for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they were	267.59820556640625

i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan	170.9522247314453
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger	185.70506286621094
days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course	603.262451171875

no sir before all who are here  alberts witnesses looked at each other	293.9413146972656
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	187.385986328125

villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lyingno doubt asleepon the sofa	290.8071594238281
as long as it was dark they remained silent in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every side	166.39898681640625
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection	620.5078125

she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty	573.8660888671875
although dartagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words	506.3074951171875
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii	216.895263671875
these three windows were in madame de saintmérans room	53.04601287841797
but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain	209.84742736816406

morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word	129.0679168701172
to purchase back my liberty said the cardinal	43.97956085205078
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides  good lord	378.9792175292969
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity	353.0213623046875
but go on what about the club in the rue saintjacques  why they induced general quesnel to go there and general quesnel who quitted his own house at nine oclock in the evening was found the next day in the seine  0151m    and who told you this fine story  the king himself  well then in return for your story continued noirtier i will tell you another  my dear father i think i already know what you are about to tell me  ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor  not so loud father i entreat of youfor your own sake as well as mine	124.58733367919922
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips	150.1709747314453
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance	344.9434509277344
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria  as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought	188.7042694091797

in a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count	87.15653228759766
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven  then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice	122.25423431396484
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs	170.87904357910156
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean	144.582275390625
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressingroom	156.33319091796875
however ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at crèvecœur	125.64420318603516

and who was he  twas that low fellow bonacieux  and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street	275.7359924316406
he commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed	245.9930877685547
in the name of heaven madame said villefort where is the doctor	60.9468994140625
taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie	652.3406982421875
clear sky swiftflitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château dif seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy	130.28964233398438
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m de saintméran i applied my smellingsalts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse  villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied	123.6028823852539

mazarin replied dartagnan bursting into a laugh	37.538822174072266
at the sixth cabaret then as we said dartagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him	185.4350128173828
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewherehave i not obeyed	220.00326538085938
she has taken care for herselfat least i hope sofor her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me	211.99510192871094
bicarat was a gascon as dartagnan was he turned a deaf ear and contented himself with laughing and between two parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword here cried he parodying a verse of the bible here will bicarat die for i only am left and they seek my life  but there are four against you leave off i command you  ah if you command me thats another thing said bicarat	264.4870300292969
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion	51.28929901123047
every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves	212.51358032226562
you have forgotten it porthos said he	72.55917358398438
linen and wine are both being warmed come  the young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely	192.58251953125
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinals guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur dartagnan  that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase  tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him	165.93458557128906
40048m    when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name	159.32835388183594
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them	90.6018295288086
ali pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to france when he was gazetted lieutenantgeneral  so that now inquired the abbé	156.47564697265625
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre	353.613037109375
the groom cried aloud for help	74.75885009765625
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god	217.31224060058594
did you drink some too m noirtier  yes  and did you also discover a bitter taste  yes  oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	328.7368469238281
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging mebesides i may not be there myself  where  at your ball  why should you not be there  because you have not yet invited me  but i come expressly for that purpose  you are very kind but i may be prevented  if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments  tell me what it is  my mother begs you to come  the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting	111.46571350097656
but what can be the matter	45.65005874633789
ah indeed said davrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to younoirtier did not let him finish	189.8164520263672
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly	591.1278686523438
the poor girl ventured a glance at dartagnan which said see how i suffer on your account  toward the end of the evening however the beautiful lioness became milder she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of dartagnan and even gave him her hand to kiss	162.9653778076172
after all continued dartagnan there was certainly one with aramis	303.7297668457031
two men to the astonishment of dartagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier	230.16403198242188
he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuilthe terror of all expert palates	174.3515625
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy	292.6744689941406
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me  oh cried andrea leaping with joy	104.61173248291016
you hailed me i think  danglars retreated a step or two	299.4150695800781
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	101.39103698730469
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	187.21566772460938
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village  curé	336.5080871582031
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentines death	74.1774673461914
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan  these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated	283.0127868652344
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner	67.07417297363281
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal	114.95093536376953

the bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom	103.18413543701172
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose  no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master  or his mistress interrupted dartagnan	127.56410217285156
the night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of  moccoletti  repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd	196.5130615234375
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you  my love for you	80.81999206542969

if you     are not located in the united states you will have to check the laws     of the country where you are located before using this ebook	46.757301330566406

franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert	169.2958221435547
a second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a flag	359.05902099609375
i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you i can scarcely stand  the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity	111.4601821899414
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine	116.88799285888672
i repeat it dartagnan you are the best one among us i bless and love you my dear son  and to think that i couldnt find that out said porthos scratching his head it is so simple  but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh  athos shuddered and turned pale	131.62904357910156
50089m    maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtiers eyes seemed to sayquicker quicker  in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentines	168.1454315185547
dartagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms	40.093082427978516
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening	66.91680908203125

he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	75.78974151611328
he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness	526.0671997070312
doctor davrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall	125.76329803466797

in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them	224.76390075683594
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms	118.93061065673828
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson  french had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter	145.05101013183594

he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and reenter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra	294.4658508300781
he has orders to do so	62.92670440673828

a deathlike silence oppressed all nature	158.37229919433594
a few hundred yards beyond the town dartagnan drew rein	210.1732940673828

without having been in the school of the abbé faria the worthy master of  la jeune amélie  the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provençal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support	280.4077453613281
the morning dawned dull and gloomy and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink	251.49842834472656
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive	228.3032989501953
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient	273.65167236328125

only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest	123.74222564697266
dartagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or lookingindeed as if he had never seen them before	145.99000549316406

the steward could not restrain himself	55.30937194824219
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman	129.70962524414062
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivains respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention	291.40472412109375
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise	455.63787841796875

i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom murmured athos and the travelers continued their route	207.23912048339844

theres one just arrived and she handed the letter to dartagnan	71.59980773925781
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans face	290.0633239746094
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully	409.7246398925781

otherwise you see although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance  mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at dartagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance	210.5355987548828
bonacieux we must have them back again  yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am i to act	142.18763732910156

he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire	191.59275817871094
a last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the breach	120.97180938720703
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon	375.3492736816406
but what can i do for you  then dartagnan told m de tréville a long history about the queen	72.04997253417969

at the word  notary  noirtier made a sign to her to stop	65.65116119384766
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	149.93980407714844
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated	145.3241424560547

the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coachhouses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters	196.4375457763672
a loud cry could be heard by her	31.669029235839844

go  the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him	183.98956298828125
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugénie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty	201.6291961669922
beyond that hedge that garden and that cottage a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slepta vast void from which glittered a few luminous points the funeral stars of that hell	707.0726318359375

it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	274.4356994628906
and the other  which  the short one  oh he was not a gentleman ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration  some lackey murmured dartagnan	226.8075408935547

dartagnan cried she is it you	95.28108215332031

this is not his writing said athos	33.20320510864258

0065m    as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event	398.6524963378906
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing	369.2022399902344

then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods justice  he will be found  well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required  your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really isthat is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	146.52435302734375
dartagnan gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time	186.3638153076172
i have just made m de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned	114.82427978515625

ah continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the  tavoletta  and if he can send us an account of the execution  there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets for i saw the account and copied it down  very well you can retire m bertuccio i need you no longer	111.60393524169922
i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor monsieur de chavigny though ive been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet but i then replied probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good my pastry not good	175.81161499023438

they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their booty	593.4813842773438
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to dartagnans face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king	214.25144958496094
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it  ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth	207.1750946044922
m de tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair	104.35688781738281
this noble gentleman with his lofty glance this handsome cavalier so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command	208.3907928466797
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on	398.07708740234375

yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit	237.22068786621094
i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more	100.26280212402344
if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one	560.7545166015625
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards theres no use in thinking any more about athos	229.58636474609375

dartagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains	540.13037109375
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known	181.50210571289062
dartagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it	136.1888427734375
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman  that he may be at ease  is that all  he will know what that means  he will guess at least	110.62908172607422
after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened	219.89190673828125

i hope so was the reply	69.14752960205078

morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural history	249.41371154785156
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time	143.59039306640625
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a military cut	216.02577209472656

40152m    as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressingroom this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect	204.98182678222656
very well my lord it shall be so  dartagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarins flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness	293.40484619140625

he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself	132.2001953125
how much in that little bag  seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs  seven thousand livres cried porthos	214.47909545898438
with monsieur  monsieur has returned then  of course naively replied the servant	304.78857421875
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house  i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man	61.96990966796875
i am expiating a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la carconte when she complains hold your tongue woman it is the will of god and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance	162.9363250732422
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king	168.7588653564453
and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded marketplace  my lord replied the messenger i wish to speak to your eminence in secret	118.84619140625
god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home  poor valentine  i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless	240.8357391357422
i am brave when i set about it	91.81340026855469
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared	215.4146728515625
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same time  mme	152.265869140625
they are beating the general alarm  the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	231.88351440429688
has morrel whom we know been killed	212.81466674804688
the door of their cabin was opened	64.33915710449219
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthoss opinion  is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	112.37165832519531
he took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids	79.86610412597656
i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle	276.27838134765625
julie threw herself into the arms of the count emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead	92.72346496582031
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes	126.84805297851562
as for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him	116.83946228027344
you must be satan cried she	100.06415557861328
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result	242.26466369628906
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs	168.3026580810547
continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband  julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster	263.7028503417969
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal	125.67739868164062
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twentyfive years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist	157.3763427734375
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos	49.77704620361328
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti  count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow	126.74979400634766
what then are you  i am about to tell you wretched man  oh mon dieu  i am john francis de winter  i do not know you said the executioner	51.56330490112305
luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house	110.30297088623047
all this looks suspicious  they said a quarter of an hour	42.71464538574219
she continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it	81.59696197509766
m danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 francs	274.8191223144531
what is your name in your turn if you please  dartagnan  to yours monsieur  and above all others cried dartagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the cardinal  the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of dartagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was convinced	116.26097869873047
i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion	170.3554229736328
upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a tremble	73.67405700683594
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château dif that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villeforts promise	150.082275390625
till we meet again then dear traitor  till we meet again my forgetful charmer  tomorrow my angel  tomorrow flame of my life     chapter xxx	1300.0511474609375

in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared	479.0120544433594
once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction	529.2005615234375
i am a priest resumed aramis	193.28529357910156
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan  thank you sirthank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world  debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame  madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her	202.43649291992188
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances	60.718841552734375
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by dartagnan and porthos	111.8636703491211
ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart	209.37326049804688
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head	100.04130554199219
farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart	202.67893981933594
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret	143.82797241210938
one would think it had been placed here on purpose  get on it thats it friend  and dartagnan coughed	418.6045837402344
but fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes	329.881103515625
ah assunta cried i you are an excellent woman and heaven will bless you  this said monte cristo is less correct than your philosophyit is only faith  alas your excellency is right replied bertuccio and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment	131.08511352539062
now the queen is of a sensitive nature	328.1334228515625
adieu  thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him	113.55880737304688
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith	94.08045959472656
but my fears were this time illfounded i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i dreaded	225.68943786621094
are we to pass the night in the kings room asked dartagnan	42.57640838623047
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling	305.0657043457031
and what may be that description  dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his buttonhole a hat with wide brim and a cane  ah ha thats it is it said noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him  because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coqhéron  didnt i say that your police were good for nothing  yes but they may catch him yet  true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance at these words he rose and put off his frockcoat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his sons toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers	184.81478881835938
toward eleven oclock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court	218.5444793701172
i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men i encircled the castle the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out which i did not expect till tomorrow and i didnt hope to free you without a skirmish	275.25927734375
pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master	124.76521301269531
for instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end	220.73904418945312
athos walked about in a contemplative mood	116.65068817138672
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit	114.04104614257812
the several members of that group were much excited	479.6016845703125
as porthos and aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his clothes	176.7107696533203
he had now leisure to look to his wound	66.5953140258789
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner	85.14688873291016
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh	87.58444213867188
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat	157.05743408203125
what have you done with monsieur de bruy	20.703933715820312
is all safe m morrel and i think you will be satisfied on that head	55.560062408447266
joy shone in raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle	100.67820739746094
the breakfasthour arrived but m de villefort was not at table	46.324501037597656
two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was grimaud on his way to paris	118.85814666748047
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it	257.5830078125
i demand the suppression of the thesis  since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably	300.8352966308594
but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage a smile lit up the old mans face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face	364.4437561035156
whats to be done  what did the cardinal say about me  i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do  i must then remain here  here or in the neighborhood  you cannot take me with you  no the order is imperative	142.54098510742188
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transactioni come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter  there was a doubtful expression in noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so	116.10236358642578
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds	53.42743682861328
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs	438.06610107421875
count she said bragelonne must be a charming place	154.63035583496094
i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence  you must still deliver it said athos	71.73011016845703
the bastion st gervais replied dartagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen  was that affair hot  yes moderately so	652.3239135742188
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty	95.1517333984375
he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other	136.80267333984375
peste  edmond you have a very handsome mistress  she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed  sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile	100.5495834350586
beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone	156.6903076171875
gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and retailed the jests of beautin the count de villeroy and marechal de la meilleraie	59.96221923828125
when quite a child the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity	277.3882751464844
i should never have the courage to come down again  ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of reason  what is his folly  he fancies he possesses an immense treasure	287.216796875
dartagnan when he gave way to his own feelingswhich were in accordance with those of the queenhad accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted	168.27658081054688
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you  oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear	161.6421356201172
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio	55.565120697021484
the office of the kings attorney chapter 68	179.07986450195312

he again ran back to the château	20.527637481689453
there was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria	159.29364013671875

the king made his entrance into paris on the twentythird of december of the same year	104.21954345703125
adieu  adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate	120.07637023925781
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of everblooming shrubs everripe fruit and everlovely virgins	393.1370544433594
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of dartagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders	298.7992248535156
let me be on my guard  and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied	139.90115356445312
at this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult	279.2184143066406
have you seen anything they asked	153.3892822265625
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it	113.90660095214844
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home  be easy	378.98321533203125
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de larbresec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor and gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu	169.89263916015625
father and son  m noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	141.96548461914062
my daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry  eugénie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion	208.62213134765625
saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom	597.72412109375
the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of pèrelachaise where m de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family	87.77412414550781
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	295.2232360839844
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st louis above the order of notredamedumontcarmel and st lazare and gave it to villefortin the meanwhile take this cross  sire said villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers cross   ma foi  said louis xviii take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another	176.58627319335938
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village	273.6418762207031
well how much for the equipments  if we say one hundred pistoles for the three  good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty  porthos made a sign of assent	131.69522094726562
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his lips	272.206298828125
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand	103.47844696044922
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse	175.712890625
pray tell me how  i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oilhere is my lamp so saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations	378.14434814453125
as to the sailors of the  pharaon  they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared	220.05320739746094
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring	220.2344970703125
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto  thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply  what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed  a womans letter monseigneur  ah yes i see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know i have taken orders  monseigneur said athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a womans letter but it is neither signed marion de lorme nor madame daiguillon  the cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his eyes	158.81719970703125
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it	152.3932647705078
at daybreak i left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep	492.4508972167969
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last comminges appeared pushing broussel before him	399.12628173828125
he could not understand how alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation	305.7883605957031
they want to arrest master broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs  the crowd began to murmur and approached the house	172.1166534423828
ah  perbacco  indispensable were they  certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child  true said the major there might be doubts raised  in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated  it would be fatal to his interests  it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance   o peccato   you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity  that is the misfortune	199.2347412109375
come speak  monsieur de cavois  monsieur de cavois  in person  the captain of the cardinals guards  himself  did he come to arrest me  i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling manner  was he so sweet then  indeed he was all honey monsieur  indeed  he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palaisroyal   it was called the palaiscardinal before richelieu gave it to the king	93.02256774902344
at the names comte de la fere and chevalier dherblay charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene	59.494285583496094
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly	340.4227600097656
but when i have found them then tremble sir	512.6055908203125
the plan adopted by dartagnan was soon perfected	260.671875
countess returned franz totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband  nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself  perhaps you never before noticed him  what a questionso truly french	229.2191619873047
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage	105.99193572998047
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections	325.9352722167969
before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition	702.8810424804688
i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne	178.64369201660156
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images	262.9346618652344
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report	256.3374938964844
but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m davrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms	146.2689971923828
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person  yes but in our situation we must not say all we knowparticularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues  well can i see porthos  certainly monsieur	130.95098876953125
he no longer feared realities but phantoms	1228.928955078125
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said dartagnan people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven  monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal  well but my poor bazin reflect a little	263.4390563964844
he is not dead then  no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood	203.20663452148438
yes sir  a whole bottle if you will drink my health  willingly answered the soldier	158.36451721191406
it begins to develop itself said dartagnan	46.07875061035156
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris	124.51736450195312
the age of this singular man who is of no age is then i am certain thirtyfive	120.8313217163086
the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road	131.492919921875
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines  are you a surgeon asked de guiche	202.52764892578125

he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the illjoined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars	211.07920837402344

the vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again	53.44706726074219
the bolt gave way and the door opened	51.580013275146484

caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it	144.0570831298828
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no  no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first  i do signified the old man	158.24215698242188
and now my good friend said dartagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak  the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man dartagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets	119.29621124267578
but the first was repugnant to him	63.02195739746094

at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	49.408626556396484
i am of a frankness of character quite french  rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile	252.0967254638672

and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison	370.20001220703125

a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him	108.19200897216797
i will even venture to say that i am certain m de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event	124.66970825195312
but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody  you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him	211.44105529785156
i told you so said dartagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms it  and you monsieur dartagnan what do you want  my lord said dartagnan it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant  yes and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain  dartagnan bowed	136.08499145507812
in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably	707.7975463867188
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes	184.72666931152344
the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard	142.68357849121094
0329m    but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention  and so he was murmured caderousse	148.34056091308594
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished	418.861572265625
0255m    the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old mans limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open	239.17562866210938
it is god himself who sent us here  yes said porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him  no replied dartagnan no noise	124.70966339111328

tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning     he has given	217.96646118164062
who and what are you demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hours time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim	279.4291076660156

messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinals guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you	188.9854736328125
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	113.88036346435547
oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross kneebreeches  and how shall i be dressed demanded andrea	363.62823486328125

and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it	78.96037292480469
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege  never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty	507.7792053222656
the evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death	427.1260986328125
you met a monk did you not  yes  the young men looked at each other with an expression of fear	46.30812454223633
what are you bringing me said he	23.782052993774414
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits	89.31826782226562
perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome  but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos	200.69033813476562
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach	209.56793212890625
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go	90.23734283447266
my friend cried athos suddenly where have you brought us	441.374755859375
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb	308.60711669921875
and madame de villefort cried baptistin	32.630802154541016
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her	161.93197631835938
milady rushed to the door and opened it	24.631855010986328

at ten oclock the kings collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers	99.28134155273438
it was indeed mousquetonmousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing dartagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary	408.2658386230469
dartagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds	209.06300354003906
aha continued dartagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced	252.0047607421875
how strong one feels here said porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands	220.16090393066406
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin  i hope so  and when will the dance begin  the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow morning  you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier dhumieres has promised me whenever i need them  upon fifty soldiers  yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them  good my dear rochefort but that is not all	202.30564880371094
they will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it  does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day  by bacchus rejoined mazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are  there is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out  thats my concern i will make him speak  ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out  pooh	175.6339874267578
you forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church  my dear bazin you ought to perceive said dartagnan from the place in which you find me that i am greatly changed in everything	176.13626098632812
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney	86.42872619628906
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house  valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event  what voices asked valentine	294.61895751953125
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	293.3853759765625
a quarter of an hour later he was at greenwich	40.444374084472656
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture	108.17143249511719
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility	446.0635986328125
dartagnan followed him and mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans	156.3988800048828

still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels	352.7796936035156
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey	108.01705169677734

remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man  young man said richelieu if i shall be able to say to you at another time what i have said to you today i promise you to do so  this last expression of richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed dartagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning	119.67919921875
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you	271.6798400878906

the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it	403.8437805175781
sir said dartagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side  no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers  well that is scarcely the question	167.82061767578125
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him	251.2319793701172
now my dear guitant i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory  you have found that out have you my lord	179.35572814941406

in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	788.3377685546875
and as the man approached dartagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern	125.99175262451172

madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect  at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity	78.69124603271484
the cardinal as his majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the kings gaming table	339.7611083984375
i speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your friends  aha thought the gascon is this a snare or not	183.1815643310547

now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much	198.8710174560547

as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid	152.33543395996094
dartagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung	235.64862060546875
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he  madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate	155.01040649414062

he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us yet in spite of his earnest prayers dantès remained a prisoner	331.341552734375

i broke my word it is true but what signifies that	112.70211029052734
it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf	55.16984558105469

the air the fresh free air is so good besides and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke i am going into the country to make a tour  stop cried dartagnan i too am going  and if i may without impertinence askwhere are you going  to seek my friends  what friends  those that you asked about yesterday  athos porthos and aramisyou are looking for them  yes  on honor  what then is there surprising in that  nothing	205.04322814941406

they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach	137.15924072265625
a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed	116.72357940673828
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage	260.2181091308594

night overtook her she stopped and slept at an inn	128.2961883544922
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like dartagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light dartagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville	172.9094696044922
ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali and were received by the abbé busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse	82.24046325683594

the countenance of old dantès brightened	338.7731628417969
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the  pharaon	92.62474060058594
but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody  so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate  but this is trampling on the weak sir  the weakness of a murderer  his dishonor reflects upon us  is not death in my house  oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you  be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture	161.09588623046875

milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked dartagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england	117.05532836914062
noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all	180.01992797851562
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person	327.2989501953125
diable  when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father	190.44708251953125
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	265.1203918457031
at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account  penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them	145.87762451171875
why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain yourself  i must refer again to the club in the rue saintjacques  it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police	164.383544921875

dartagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning	185.50106811523438
for himself he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinals vengeance and as was well known the vengeance of his eminence was terrible	90.7649917602539

he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	56.86526870727539
that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february	197.9412078857422
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees	249.8534393310547
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight oclock in the morning	68.77915954589844

you see i have not these necessary papers  fortunately i have them though said monte cristo	194.9176788330078
of the evil you have done said the voice	27.997787475585938
by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write	181.07894897460938
the silence however could not last forever	181.4152374267578
well i went to a horse dealers where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named médéah	105.10303497314453
in addition to this after a half hours conversation dartagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head	231.54388427734375
yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously	531.6876831054688

bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone  milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken	166.8973846435547
my lord said dartagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time	150.13482666015625
let us go to monsieur de beaufort  the two friends went to the hotel de vendome	26.876136779785156
dartagnan was acquainted with villarscotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time villarscotterets was a royal residence	257.6600341796875

their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant	499.52197265625
madame de chevreuse whose name appears so often in our story the three musketeers without her actually having appeared in any scene was still a beautiful woman	255.98316955566406
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	103.66532135009766
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily	198.96737670898438
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians dartagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	399.8991394042969
the abbé told me it was worth 50000 francs muttered caderousse	112.74478912353516
what news exclaimed a general burst of voices	333.9394836425781
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	648.2778930664062
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god  edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory	235.82757568359375

the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch  this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos	110.3411636352539
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon dartagnan when he spared the life of her brother	138.6218719482422
and yet frightful though this spot may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered it is so rare for them to leave the lions den for any other place than the barrier saintjacques the galleys	206.63473510742188
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner	113.1732177734375
dearest exclaimed valentine with her adorable smile awake and look at me morrel uttered a loud exclamation and frantic doubtful dazzled as though by a celestial vision he fell upon his knees	221.56423950195312

they reached the rue st honoré and in the place du palaiscardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades	227.63238525390625
she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard all	125.23609161376953
besides i am here in my own country and that excites me  and both with free use of the spur arrived at st omer without drawing bit	276.7222900390625
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it  sir said planchet i am in all things at your service  that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his horse	140.4113311767578

what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos	104.48545837402344
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder	69.99381256103516
diable   a pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with anxiety	55.78017807006836
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably well	93.89907836914062
youve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven	47.41402053833008
morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me  no count but to leave paris  if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there  valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time  maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them	186.60986328125
it was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison	496.846435546875
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme	332.28057861328125
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel	153.37896728515625
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money	186.70669555664062
they explained what had occurred that evening	162.19944763183594
then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelingsi have a son said he and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins  general said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyit is the privilege of weakness	174.5422821044922
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord	413.9729919433594
well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesi cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free  unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	344.7494201660156
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion	206.7875213623047
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject  a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady	83.47770690917969
she took me away without speaking	76.9715805053711
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening	793.90771484375
it will be useless for him to find you here  she rang the bell and kitty appeared	140.6985321044922
you are not joking are you  no on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him	106.42382049560547
this feeling lasted but for a moment	26.964466094970703
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes	122.36476135253906
you are only betrayed  the king sighed deeply	162.70199584960938
now will you make me a report of all that has happened  why i have related the events to you	71.34185791015625
it turned out as dartagnan had foreseen	94.46186828613281
the young man was opening the door of the stable	36.01921844482422
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder	85.41450500488281
on these days he spoke a little	110.31391906738281
eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer and escaped	67.67774963378906
and here he comes by jupiter	352.2162780761719
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful	91.4159927368164
well what is it asked louis xviii	105.15862274169922
who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty	459.2211608886719
to have to make a false excuse to porthos	98.94215393066406
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous	505.0365905761719
holloa patrick  sign my lord  never  never  help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword	84.32003021240234

i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me	64.32964324951172
mazarin took the letter and read it thus  mr	286.5841979980469
my faith said aramis we are all alike	115.80689239501953
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	143.67127990722656
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england	130.7729034423828
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered	333.8651428222656
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was halfpast	162.02589416503906
this time without knowing why dartagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins	265.946044921875
he held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin	130.5088348388672
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it	288.8429260253906
certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine but the accomplice shall become the avenger	222.94578552246094
i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody  we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness	131.77870178222656

but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic beauchamp  i  yes you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine  ah yes so i was	245.7433624267578
m noirtier again closed his eyes	14.84164810180664
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient  well said monte cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house  take care said madame de villefort the kings attorney is here  ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration  your declaration said villefort	79.11900329589844
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from dartagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment	123.06436157226562
well have you sent asked monte cristo seeing morrel return	257.2781066894531
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition  oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize	129.50628662109375
pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears it  sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign	257.6986389160156
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you  the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed	112.39122772216797
our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna  well said franz this time m albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea  and quite a national one too replied albert with gratified pride	340.481689453125
absolution  tell me her name and i will give it  her name wasmy god have pity on me murmured the executioner and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die	88.41046142578125
all had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except athos knew mme	336.09271240234375
and now said dartagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret  i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos	85.65302276611328
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter  yes where is this letter cried dartagnan	89.19352722167969
never mind said milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper i will compromise myself  well said rochefort taking the paper from milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be easy	164.66661071777344
do i for instance fare better	1202.12939453125
this is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight years  fair said athos is she not  very  blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows  yes  tall wellmade	215.11770629882812
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc dangoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle	147.06838989257812
valentine tell him if you love maximilian  the count felt his heart dilate and throb he opened his arms and haydée uttering a cry sprang into them	199.55523681640625
the countess de winter   as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from dartagnan not all that had happened but what dartagnan himself knew	180.9640655517578
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these	504.8540344238281
knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by  friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said  it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel  on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal	115.52339935302734
i shrink before nothing but impossibilities  nothing is impossible replied milady to true love  nothing madame  nothing replied milady	386.0259094238281
albert related it to his mother châteaurenaud recounted it at the jockey club and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the counts courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy	173.03367614746094
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop	144.50399780273438

as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel	196.93386840820312
he sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was over	155.54188537597656
oh curses woe death to you  he tried to follow monte cristo but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spothis eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire	209.49400329589844

she heard the counts sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses     chapter 87	363.9002380371094
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still	183.21441650390625
be easy on that head replied athos you know i am cool enough  porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe	144.47340393066406
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him  you swear sir that it is not so  stop and aramis gave him a louis dor	78.38796997070312
but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down	264.44024658203125

can we have the honor of seeing his highness  i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on	102.41459655761719

take it and there ends the matter  what cried athos are you selling my horsemy bajazet	386.7907409667969

the affair at armentieres whispered dartagnan	159.22833251953125

well said franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure  laugh if you pleasei really think so	215.22830200195312
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts	449.3994140625
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils	173.97674560546875
by no means it really seems to me very curious  yes indeed	211.88250732421875

the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was	105.15968322753906
the man took his way toward the city	83.59561920166016
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there	214.67103576660156
at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant	216.8184356689453
go on who were those men  one of them was a foreigner english i think	195.5081024169922

the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky	116.7989730834961
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room	119.7795639038086
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty	512.5308227539062
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed	256.0691223144531
here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman  to fontainebleau replied eugénie with an almost masculine voice	285.400634765625

the solitary light burning at the catalans that first sight of the château dif which told him whither they were leading him the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his foreheadall these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality	171.64013671875
aramis and dartagnan whispered to each other	30.822099685668945

i know what is become of vasiliki and haydée	259.6599426269531
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence  who are they replied the duke	149.67755126953125
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens	224.344482421875
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio	207.78533935546875
a light cloud passed over the counts face	60.30291748046875

for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young againa face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercédès my betrothed  40268m    the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry  edmond dantès  then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligiblehome home  the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived	246.78848266601562
it was five oclock in the afternoon i ascended into the red room and waited for night	76.37017822265625
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which i consider quite beneath me	168.64657592773438
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind	83.92811584472656
did you say he was coming  yes summoned by m de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled	157.23068237304688
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	100.86619567871094

that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude  you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvreall which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first  we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham	135.0680694580078

jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was	192.0364532470703

where is the key you speak of  here it is  ah my lord	93.56369018554688
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past	256.3860168457031
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé	397.4555358886719
but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them	402.76971435546875
you will do for me what you have done for the queen  certainly dartagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out	72.83624267578125
really said she i believe you now begin to hesitate  no i do not hesitate but i really pity this poor comte de wardes since you have ceased to love him	110.40579223632812
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal  yes and the queen too  the queen do you say  to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i dont know how she has regained possession  but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you  so i think replied dartagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them  yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and youto whom are you devoted now  to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devotion also  and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf  magnificent my dear fellow magnificent	145.9771270751953
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow  as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains	176.95199584960938
the abbess introduced them to each other	70.5964584350586
yes you said you had an idea said athos	69.68247985839844
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of	234.7227325439453
he leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making a rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon	109.7322006225586
you asked me just now if i was in funds said dartagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table	94.12644958496094
and now my young friend for you will permit me i hope to give you that name said lord de winter on this very evening if agreeable to you i will present you to my sister milady clarik for i am desirous that she should take you into her good graces and as she is not in bad odor at court she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you  dartagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of assent	115.30584716796875
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course	164.4309844970703
the four or five remaining hours before nine oclock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visitsdesigned to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the bankers in their gayest equipagesdazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative	326.74383544921875
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation	120.20326232910156
but dartagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts	289.9223937988281
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied dartagnan	131.21450805664062
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket	164.30361938476562
emmanueljuliefarewell  how farewell exclaimed julie do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport  needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite at least i advised him to do so  i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner	226.84767150878906
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk	190.2183837890625
dartagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold	170.66201782226562
here doctor said he is what you sent me for  was this prepared in your presence  yes replied the procureur	134.98231506347656
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	257.4773864746094
we will grow old together and talk of our companions  no replied dartagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin i wish to be there i expect to get something by it  what do you expect to get  why i expect to be made marechal of france  ha	165.9230499267578
madame more hopeless than he thinks	163.7572021484375
villefort burst it open with a violent blow	57.643165588378906
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majestys guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friends and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors  the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you  we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service  then said tréville it was also for your majestys service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majestys service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace  bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed  monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance  i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there  the king looked at the cardinal	147.43118286132812
you shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission well  the messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and retired	143.764404296875
here father here he said take thistake it and send for something immediately and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six fivefranc pieces and some smaller coin	172.6665802001953
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentlemans word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so  thats porthos all over murmured dartagnan	169.6482391357422
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room	37.833492279052734
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse  but he will not wish for only one harness  stake both  pardieu  i am not selfish as you are  you would do so said dartagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself	178.2686004638672
the name of your ship inquired dartagnan	189.19908142089844
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair  incognita  belonged to the aristocracy	659.9799194335938
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa	50.14220428466797
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river	153.07435607910156
there is no god there is no providenceall comes by chance  there is a providence there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him  but who are you then asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count	197.54095458984375
as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else	315.65087890625
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position	105.54338073730469
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside	85.5531005859375
she loved porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus she made him a sign to dismount and come to her	82.19525909423828
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace  you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to dartagnan who pressed it respectfully	77.65843963623047
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground	201.36199951171875
the steward wished to turn to the left	82.43846893310547
i think so answered albert in a firm tone	58.14304733276367
give him a lesson debray  stay said beauchamp surely i am not deceived  what is it  it is she  whom do you mean  they said she had left  mademoiselle eugénie said châteaurenaud has she returned  no but her mother  madame danglars	158.40809631347656
you at least will be faithful to me arthur  the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the kings face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure	314.9963684082031
you will find him quite enthusiastic  upon what subject asked madame danglars	470.54364013671875
two varieties of demons  chapter lxiii	27.484848022460938
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not signed	110.8414535522461
ah may you be a true prophet said dartagnan laughing	60.75136947631836
presentlythere are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be remarked  at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor	111.13003540039062
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me  athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	99.05705261230469
you know he has estatesporthos  i should think so indeed	123.77108764648438
59   quick quick said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it  monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying  you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti	117.1535415649414
to the boats my lads as quick as you can now continued penelon you see m morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get alongsave yourselves we soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it	209.1079559326172
mazarin did not even turn around	934.3529052734375
dantès followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve	248.5367431640625
mercédès raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her	83.43031311035156
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos	49.78990173339844
at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual	197.87091064453125
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger	132.30519104003906
certainly replied the count are we not in carnival time  carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to teresa	130.50901794433594
i expected him this morning  he desired me to tell your grace replied felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle  yes i know that said buckingham he has a prisoner  it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace replied felton	87.54815673828125
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained	76.6143798828125
who goes there cried a hoarse voice	52.30581283569336
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his	112.10685729980469
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted  everything depends on you  explain yourself pray  monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba	125.90689086914062
for the moment she wished nothing better	184.92877197265625
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors	319.2146911621094
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified	392.2857666015625
ask dartagnan  to london gentlemen said dartagnan	36.85128402709961
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with motherofpearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor	188.91555786132812
ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse	352.86297607421875
50109m    certainly he said your receipt is money  oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house of thomson  french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done  pardon me count pardon me  then i may keep this money  yes said danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair	145.720703125
my lord he asked where does your eminence wish monsieur comte de la fere to be lodged  in the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard is	88.40582275390625
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil bertuccio slightly started	519.0549926757812
no replied the turnkey you destroy everything	487.62335205078125
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child	87.95323181152344
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday	138.29605102539062
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs  what say you duke  i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these neverending labors	368.9472351074219
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten	243.934814453125
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife	251.560546875
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child	90.4512710571289
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house	127.06798553466797
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged the king was invited to come and see the hanging	190.5702667236328
the king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor	49.23488235473633
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	545.6226196289062
hes in the bastile  that is to say he was there replied planchet	54.36536407470703
as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window	85.7020492553711
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested	147.01243591308594
i waited your orders said dartagnan crossing swords	183.8142852783203
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	88.5813217163086
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor  0325m    i did  and you followed the business of a tailor  true i was a tailor till the trade fell off	128.54534912109375
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel	130.91815185546875
listen to me  edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him	123.55397033691406
m coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities	58.484920501708984
those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not	90.90904998779297
porthos kill every one who stands in your way  and after pressing the hand of athos dartagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist	138.5494384765625
did you come from boulogne demanded she of milady	629.7476806640625
and did you catch any of his words  i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect	93.13126373291016
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little amusement	425.1368408203125
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself  the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	120.25399780273438
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric	248.3852081298828
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare	157.3782958984375
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with châteaurenaud and beauchamp	46.59695053100586
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you	155.59283447265625
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time	390.3536071777344
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much	92.87577056884766
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy	1086.2298583984375
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens army	245.1970977783203
well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count	90.47784423828125
is he a deputy  oh no	128.28199768066406
a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing	105.35783386230469
there only they explained to them the matter in hand	95.21977233886719
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock	113.10032653808594
in a month then on your honor if i am not consoled you will let me take my life into my own hands and whatever may happen you will not call me ungrateful  in a month to the day the very hour and the date is a sacred one maximilian	103.32731628417969
but what happened after my departure  how can i tell said kitty	109.3186264038086
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	481.24127197265625
this was divided into three compartmentsone which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos porthos and aramis were to pass the night the second was to serve as the sleepingroom for the servants the third under the prow of the ship was under the temporary cabin in which mordaunt was concealed	101.0438232421875
and aramis  i have seen him also said dartagnan but he seemed to me cold  ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on dartagnan a searching look	115.2502212524414
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg electronic works to protect the project gutenberg concept and trademark	46.22651672363281
oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists sayour masters in everythingthose favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities  but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law	215.87716674804688
you mean to say we  have lost  said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table	76.67091369628906
there now m morrel thats the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings	273.46630859375
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans	256.15667724609375
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you  andrea blushed imperceptibly	118.33680725097656
never exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never	99.44541931152344
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he reentered the hôtel and flew toward kittys chamber	112.28221130371094
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat	158.5895538330078
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the  parade  he had already three inches of steel in his breast	117.29301452636719
he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain	355.85711669921875
well at twentynine i saw valentine for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife	124.05931091308594
in my country the ladies do without chambermaids	779.5814819335938
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart	241.0214080810547
dartagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	181.6842041015625

you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	171.53172302246094
danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side	233.2139434814453
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me  oh oh said dartagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso	96.03832244873047
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	154.43362426757812
my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock	102.48714447021484
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyespetticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation	168.39088439941406
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word	88.84215545654297
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart  ennui  can find no place  you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace	678.1226196289062
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy	226.8944091796875

sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here  during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said  madame princeswho by nature are above other menreceive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes	173.11521911621094
be satisfied said dartagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard  oh monsieur procurators wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier  and did you convey this answer to your guest  we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission  so that he still expects his money  oh lord yes monsieur	172.24874877929688
and wherefore fire said the colonel every one has yielded  it is the son of milady said athos to dartagnan	104.53453826904297
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it  i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois  probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord  at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	252.91305541992188
who employed you to assassinate me  a woman whom i dont know but who is called milady  but if you dont know this woman how do you know her name  my comrade knows her and called her so	94.99351501464844
do you not know the race said he	110.73928833007812
oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my arrest  the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed	258.1702880859375
we hope so answered the curates	110.81608581542969
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of laiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles  roberges  and feluccas	159.36557006835938

the island of tiboulen  dantès although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower	253.33779907226562
take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more  gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them  do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father	155.3207244873047
while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner  but the ink said dantès of what did you make your ink  there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison	235.98619079589844
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing	87.81334686279297
are you satisfied my lord he asked	52.76149368286133
i used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries	204.62860107421875
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes  good he accepts said monte cristo	148.68963623046875
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	146.98068237304688
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen  the only chance for alberts safety then will arise from your emotion  i suffer from emotion said monte cristo	154.444091796875

a daughter of henry iv of that great that sublime sovereign  all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his soninlaw sir	264.0355224609375
about this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand	96.67808532714844
it was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation	208.33624267578125
scarcely had dartagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night	137.18807983398438
is it my father  no  madame de villefort  no  me the former sign was repeated	125.12566375732422
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him	145.95428466796875
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees	53.986087799072266
take my advice renounce this woman	121.39722442626953
now i am alone my dear athos said dartagnan open the door i beg of you  instantly said athos	67.06185913085938

that knife was for you my lad she would have killed you	126.63284301757812
to regret the world is to regret the devil that is my conclusion  and that is mine also said the curate	101.43557739257812
come on come on said dartagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my halfpistole	134.45068359375
as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct  what a madcap i was and what a stupid fellow i am	237.13427734375
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying	423.2544860839844
i am dead drunk thats all and never did a man more strongly set about getting so	383.80157470703125
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke	47.30976104736328
the eight guards were at their posts	51.50786590576172
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded woman	144.07073974609375
this was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son	102.31761169433594
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed	73.93948364257812
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of perspiration	243.06178283691406
you will be here at halfpast nine  and i shall find your eminence ready  certainly quite ready  well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen  for what purpose  i wish to receive her majestys commands from her own lips  she desired me to give them to you  she may have forgotten something  you really wish to see her  it is indispensable my lord  mazarin hesitated for one instant but dartagnan was firm	118.98670196533203
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were	234.34329223632812
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god	195.69876098632812
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality  morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown	272.6998596191406
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas	213.51589965820312
well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment	132.91090393066406
if i had but the time to train pupils	429.8859558105469
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket  the casket would encumber you	186.78221130371094
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle	174.55926513671875
you have succeeded the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight	186.25595092773438
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	33.85194778442383
i only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions  the devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed  hors de combat  in a cabaret squabble	119.00831604003906
he is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of st sebastian  i was never in them but i have often resolved to visit them  well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better	107.02794647216797
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box	105.367431640625
singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocketbook	134.1764373779297
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father  my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian  julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten	277.7235107421875
the friend of my greatest foes	737.1619262695312
i feel myself quite in a humor for it and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine  upon my word the drum draws near said dartagnan	141.58023071289062
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person	137.85728454589844
where is there any to be found  i can show you answered the gascon	75.1143569946289
ah my poor friends murmured dartagnan where are you	102.49687194824219
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know	841.1177978515625
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me  i have also sent for the procureur  he will not come in time i feel my life fast ebbing  wait a moment said monte cristo	127.4068374633789
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length dartagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick	143.37515258789062
the feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pistoles	41.44048309326172
she had fled with him from her convent  with your brother  yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death	141.80813598632812
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather	215.6686248779297
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab  and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison  certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed  yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it  oh very easily	207.1126708984375
at five oclock albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome	189.90199279785156
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as ninetenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step	321.8479919433594
well said renée i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your owna physician for instance	252.42713928222656
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto athos and aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety	97.44015502929688
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects  grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy	259.31793212890625
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh recovered	180.90158081054688
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina	934.855224609375
help comrades help  by a rapid movement which the gendarmes practiced eye had perceived dantès sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat	226.7252655029297
adieu raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy  adieu sir adieu my beloved protector  athos waved his handhe dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered	216.72520446777344
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house  then you abandon me doctor  yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold	141.4173583984375
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselvesfor my fortune is theirsbefore me they were nothingafter me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacityineptitude	163.09512329101562
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend dartagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal  what	242.09051513671875
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	132.94525146484375
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majestys letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it  the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly	136.51100158691406
so he cherishes no resentment  you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	75.10010528564453
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you  for monsieur de wardes said kitty	84.32341003417969
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerfs	124.10481262207031
the hostess replied only by gasps	244.3042755126953
now at the moment when i left his house  here aramis paused	157.21290588378906
this clever person is your relative then  cousingerman  go on to your cousin then  aramis continued  my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la rochelle	141.6256103515625
but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire	583.721435546875
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone	401.0142822265625
i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son well then to save my son i will sacrifice my life nay even my fortune  what do you mean  i mean that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune	87.61180114746094
grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use	265.8835144042969
soon said haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake	160.63580322265625
m de la trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to life	215.88356018066406
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another person  and who is that other person asked milady warmly	298.0614013671875
0295m    it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto	217.55673217773438
oh were i not a foreigner	91.76958465576172
the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and i have heard nothing of either of them since	100.29163360595703
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time	87.23594665527344
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps  follow me monsieur said mazarin	255.25755310058594
what prevents you from being so  oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars  marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders	95.6123275756836
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands  you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much  you have rightly guessed madame replied the count	129.5262451171875
she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you	193.5666046142578
undoubtedly the call came from farias dungeon	635.380859375
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	86.77439880371094
they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of braccianos ball to which all rome was invited	121.66744995117188
you cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere monte cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek	181.44827270507812
hold your tongue stupid fellow said dartagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury	222.21047973632812
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart  no of taste continued franz gravely	456.1615905761719
châteaurenaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saintgermain do not pay any attention to him countlive in the chaussée dantin thats the real centre of paris  boulevard de lopéra said beauchamp the second floora house with a balcony	182.0428009033203
no monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea	209.79620361328125
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum  ah	598.6311645507812
are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project  mazarin reflected	237.5338592529297
i who was looking on an eager and curious spectatori who was watching the working of this mournful tragedyi who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching and bitten to the heart  morrel groaned	272.19073486328125
the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by davrigny	145.9254150390625
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming	213.66818237304688
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed	199.08193969726562
accordingly dartagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him	315.0221862792969
see what she writes to me athos said he	31.17091941833496
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance  and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat incredulously	383.5635681152344
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them	166.7340850830078
god who might have directed the assassins dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance	235.8974151611328
on the cross i swear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer as a thief of honor as a base coward	205.7045440673828
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope youre preparing a pretty trial  why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for  and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume  i should think not indeed	188.10691833496094
you really vilify me cried olivain	12.101651191711426
mute with horror the three friends had remained openmouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible	134.08810424804688
you have the window that is sufficient	81.78666687011719
dartagnan going to a distance to discover aramis	58.39669418334961
still further athos obtained of m de tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nightsfor they set out on the twentyfourth at five oclock in the evening and as a further kindness m de tréville postdated the leave to the morning of the twentyfifth	100.35472869873047
it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws	248.34718322753906
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass	86.85810852050781
you provide in accordance with paragraph 1f3 a full refund of         any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the         electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of         receipt of the work	156.7996368408203
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistressyour mistress above all  dartagnan blushed	287.0429382324219
bravo cried one of the guests that is what i call talking to some purpose  just the person we require at a time like the present said a second	218.52352905273438
now said the old man aid me to bury my child carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose	117.73966979980469
when a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong	235.655029296875

at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed	366.8223571777344

no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come	162.2371826171875

has he any friends then he added aloud did he make any resistance  no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance  to whom did he give up his sword  he did not give it up he broke it  he did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage  there was a momentary pause	160.5427703857422

oh their heads are soon cut off said danglars	117.8543701171875
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another	114.0117416381836
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege	287.38818359375
we are compelled to admit to our readers that dartagnan thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be	80.34345245361328

he had assigned himself the task of saving a mans life that day chance caused that man to be myself	441.8740539550781
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the wellbred from the vulgar man	227.72857666015625
not the least in the world replied bonacieux	19.638774871826172
gentlemen i know i am in the hands of an avenging god	80.46360778808594
grimaud had now finished his accounts	102.7807388305664
he therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke himself	129.80421447753906
i never lose a note of this opera if i can avoid it the music of  william tell  is so sweet     chapter 89	287.714111328125
have no more concern about me i exist no longer for you any more than if you had never seen me  must aramis do as much as i madame said dartagnan deeply piqued	111.67047882080078
bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed us	336.70758056640625
they will be ten times worse off in a week  ah yes	217.73699951171875
while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune dartagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he dartagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england	193.9107208251953
my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife  this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious	173.63438415527344
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men	145.98269653320312
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping	260.25567626953125
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks  the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully pale  i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out	160.341796875
behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation	209.654296875
you must be aware that i was ignorant of that madame  what is that stupid fellow troubling himself about cried the cavalier whom milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach window	209.9896697998047
madame replied de winter provided i can find some of my good old friends of former times i will answer for anything  come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may heaven hear you     chapter xxxvii	162.06430053710938
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god last of all i speak to you	111.33131408691406
aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins	166.82998657226562
dartagnan himself was moved by them	48.3619384765625
but you my dear dartagnan what has happened to you  so that this strain of the knee continued dartagnan my dear porthos keeps you in bed  my god thats all	147.37657165527344
have you it asked raoul  yesthat is i had it repined the gascon making believe to find it	167.6324462890625
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five oclock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the  coupé  of the diligence which closed upon her	134.83628845214844
this was the same emery who became eventually superintendent of finance	472.2870788574219
felton approached her and said lord de winter who is a catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your mass and here is a book which contains the ritual  at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words  your mass  at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer	169.6868133544922
the white flag  morbleu  we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin  and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures sake	190.56072998046875
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been	163.01776123046875
the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand in whom the grand vizier ali tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence   well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you  what do i see in it  yes what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer  it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand  did your father serve under ali pasha  yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny  oh my dear viscount do talk reason  i do not desire to do otherwise  now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person	145.21697998046875
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him	54.65904998779297
yes my lord  apropos what are the names of your friends  the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier dherblay now the abbé dherblay whom we styled aramis  the cardinal smiled	101.54344940185547
yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten	145.640625
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne	60.89031219482422
will you assure me it shall not be signed  yes said noirtier	65.15656280517578
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles	74.2810287475586
it is well sir replied villefort from belowit is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do  noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side	117.3608169555664
quite certain said milady with a last doubt	119.23558044433594
we can go to brussels liège aixlachapelle then up the rhine to strasbourg	365.1095886230469
in conscience i cannot kill him and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me	207.2694549560547
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m de tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions	134.84625244140625
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped  but athos cried dartagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he  as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty	122.1275634765625
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others  brave athos murmured dartagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence	187.3417510986328
tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst	74.84556579589844
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said	311.47607421875
why for him and not for me	46.78978729248047
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted	177.68870544433594
at the rospoli palace  the count had three windows at the rospoli palace  yes	78.40984344482422
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i cannot throw you out of window for three weeksthat is to say for twentyfour days to comenor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed	153.1129150390625
you will deliver this letter to milady	42.54933547973633
he told melet me thinkwhat was it	69.78163146972656
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me	89.23649597167969
grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything	180.56988525390625
here it is said athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform	77.48226165771484
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together	201.71343994140625
very well come this way  dartagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through	298.3274230957031
whom must i announce to my lord duke asked patrick	120.62015533447266
i say nothing about blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses	86.73663330078125
mousqueton was a norman whose pacific name of boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton	381.5924377441406
i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud	392.7445068359375
mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saintméran took and madame de saintméran is dead	55.10401153564453
from the day i first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection	259.7610168457031
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a  mésalliance	87.79630279541016
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity	357.35638427734375
this point settled the duke turned to dartagnan	50.70357894897461
yes since she lives  at that moment davrignys glance met noirtiers eye	317.5962219238281
make way for us planchet said dartagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend  planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill then he exclaimed turning to his men  let them pass they are friends  the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again	141.26705932617188
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation	116.78070068359375
but enough of thishere is my card take it to your master  madame will await my return  yes go  the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street	181.0409698486328
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten oclock	82.70655822753906
blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and when athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure	205.90188598632812
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints	186.63868713378906
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife	132.0010223388672
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that  you admit that you would fight then	210.50205993652344
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top	105.74210357666016
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	75.240966796875
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	179.76121520996094

you appear to think much of your horse	103.15570068359375
have you kept him in the cellar all this time  merciful heaven	219.97506713867188

ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him	60.41822052001953
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding	349.4120178222656

yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least  do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end	141.2499542236328
in fact a moment later m morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the  pharaon  who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own	297.53399658203125
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	269.91070556640625

can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two guards whom he introduced to his friends	54.13157272338867
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim  are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellowcitizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled  several persons hurried up to m de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy	311.55389404296875

from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each other  we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m dépinay  dear valentine  that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugénie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed  ah how good you are to say so valentine	192.85179138183594

m de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair	175.67845153808594

well said dartagnan one is never killed in a first engagement  nor in the second said aramis  nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are  no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killedwell he will die bravely but holdshould such a misfortune happenwell athos passed his hand across his pale brow	126.86741638183594
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out  doctor doctor	311.9808654785156
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that dartagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you	117.1729965209961

bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by dartagnan and porthos	33.107574462890625
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beautyit was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours	168.23934936523438
sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest  how	167.147705078125

well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair	172.76531982421875
i dont say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming true  how so  why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape  good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny	217.35765075683594

and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes  i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous  so young said albert forgetting at the moment the counts command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name  haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured  εἰπέspeak  nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness  40068m    speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say  haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile	218.48873901367188
spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die but it was a legate  à latere  who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him  spada set out about two oclock to san pierdarena	243.64256286621094

where the devil shall i say that he is so that he cannot try to rejoin him thought dartagnan	57.1635856628418

no cardinal said dartagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he  exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture	140.66110229492188

athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities	114.96739196777344
hold continued dartagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is monsieur du vallon who comes with his coat torn  yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange i have torn many skins	136.19482421875
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead	55.927940368652344
faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness	230.10401916503906
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminences commands and dartagnan unsealed the letter and read  m	143.9451446533203

i will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly	220.83644104003906
in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country	289.7869567871094
villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a housethe opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villeforts bell to summon the waitingmaid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age	123.76683807373047
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything  milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	177.797607421875
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet	156.66490173339844
by her side i am spanish but the family of morcerf is french and i have heard one of the oldest of the south of france  yes replied monte cristo these blazons prove that	81.67816925048828
it is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	141.84193420410156
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then  dartagnan tore open the envelope of the letter	114.27179718017578
a ball had passed through his breast	16.99976921081543
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said  ah	111.71260833740234
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then  my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said dartagnan	174.37059020996094
she opened it quickly and read  go this moment to the allées de meilhan enter the house no	87.70350646972656
oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship	184.92965698242188
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary	306.4447937011719
take this pen and write  caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbé sat down and wrote  sirthe man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon	133.19105529785156
but dantès cannot remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration  oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me  yes and mercédès	109.51094055175781
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ringtrue said my mother	62.02495193481445
the executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm	44.66081619262695
i will shape it out for you with my knife  and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	147.1837158203125
mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked roomshe who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little flowershe whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics	154.98098754882812
come gentlemen have you decided cried jussac for the third time	85.14290618896484
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden  i dont find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy  well replied athos have you not heard what dartagnan said  what did he say demanded porthos	211.42481994628906
let us go you mean  no my friend said athos you must leave us  leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	98.10292053222656
will your majesty deign to excuse me  speak sir speak boldly replied louis	274.3515625
his eminence then orders me said the lady	59.31195068359375
dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die	97.61869049072266
the devil murmured dartagnan all this is vague enough	215.70852661132812
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m de saintméran advertised it for sale two or three years ago  m	83.47990417480469
only imagine what happiness that would afford me	54.61119079589844
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile	143.2416229248047
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you  dartagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late	165.298095703125
and the guardsman  dartagnan  still my young scapegrace	215.4652099609375
at the hour agreed upon groslow came	185.90467834472656
come guitant come along and lets see if they keep watch at the quinzevingts as at the barriere des sergens  and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined dartagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal guitant and the rest of the escort	100.07608795166016
do you wish for any further details	186.4807891845703
why do you doubt  the pastthat obscurity on the past  but that does not affect the son  very true  now i beg of you dont go off your head	138.8967742919922
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me i was wrong a hundred times wrong	98.24063873291016
i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans	142.23890686035156
the two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances	233.31272888183594
this permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters	387.5317687988281
an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count	45.96129608154297
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners  you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey  it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad  and you are not so any longer  no captivity has subdued mei have been here so long  so longwhen were you arrested then asked the inspector	147.72618103027344
perhaps you would prefer being alone  no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the operaballs	132.1416473388672
by the female side i believe said the procurator maliciously	148.99844360351562
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table  yes monsieur  that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it  deposited with the justice they said it was bad money  very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles  but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of	279.1119079589844
that is impossible replied the governor	22.323013305664062
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him  my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long	143.2651824951172
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	217.8057403564453
and you are right said his host it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life	164.68678283691406
alas said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault  he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth	224.4476318359375
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is dead  dead dead cried patrick	103.7433090209961
leave the box sir  monte cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity	81.12757110595703
dartagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen	64.0716323852539
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door	269.8763427734375
today i am at your service replied the count	15.440199851989746
bertuccio said he give fiftyfive thousand francs to monsieur  the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of banknotes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there	129.02969360351562
eugénie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person	192.27670288085938
look at m andrea cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at murillos madonna now he is turning  this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from monte cristo silenced him	120.79589080810547
what is it  listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall  ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbés two hidingplaces	171.62777709960938
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast four	293.8526306152344
dartagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other	104.38092803955078
immediately m de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms	90.54305267333984
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia	119.51484680175781
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe	226.9165802001953
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse	63.850276947021484
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at dartagnan who was counting on his fingers	138.9613037109375
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure	141.97381591796875
thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks  the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying hes too ugly  20353m    the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed	175.7579803466797
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden  morrel looked at her with astonishment	148.9527587890625
tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow night  these blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter	325.6023864746094

my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression	137.8513641357422
the glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him	151.4314422607422
still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies	156.5530242919922
ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here  indeed said dartagnan i am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals  and i alsoi was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar selfcomplacency who is very agreeable and understands a joke i should have got a lodging elsewhere  the pretty madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthoss words for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated	203.644775390625
they are destined to produce at least ten	127.61021423339844

franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of braccianos	38.20133590698242

i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the sergeant  and here i am said the sergeant	83.72801971435547
then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried  still the hand of god  the presence of the two victims alarmed him he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses	181.4263153076172
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door	132.54527282714844
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up  and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt  it is for that reason you see me so early  because you have the order of charles iii and you wish to announce the good news to me  no because i passed the night writing lettersfiveandtwenty despatches	105.0884017944336
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another	106.26155853271484
come tell me  she had seduced and ruined my brother a priest	188.24241638183594
at this point grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet when he found a spigot he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard	214.4486083984375
but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous  in what respect  are they capable of attempting violence  dartagnan burst out laughing at the idea	395.181396484375
one only is still not in our power and braves us	65.07093048095703

the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace	223.42147827148438
send him away or you will never make a man of him  i think i shall send him to paris  so thought dartagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived	73.96315002441406
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawingroom with her little edward	44.820640563964844
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost madwhat will not reality do  but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you  which asked the young man	170.4244842529297
he found him kneeling before a  priedieu  with his head leaning on an open prayer book	190.0841827392578

at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queens invalid  as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying  vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune  then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes	121.25952911376953
no it had just struck four	731.3775024414062

what do you mean to say  i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain  you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family  no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all  and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces  then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained  the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker	148.8352508544922

yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so nobleminded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium	202.78469848632812
eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter  my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of béthune the air of which you think is bad for her	138.9244842529297
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after dartagnan	84.35887908935547
m de tréville had intimated to them his majestys fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of may and they must immediately prepare their outfits	166.79507446289062
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly  did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china	224.935546875
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again  pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment  why so	79.88617706298828
at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed	190.8958740234375
really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed  villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off	219.7687225341797
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell  but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust asked athos	201.84814453125
the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years	377.5874328613281
i think these fellows will never come  if you are in haste monsieur said dartagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you  there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to dartagnan	94.7933349609375
she stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if valentines glass were empty	183.53839111328125
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans  go my dear boy said old dantès and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son  his wife said caderousse why how fast you go on father dantès she is not his wife yet as it seems to me  no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond	137.9351348876953
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance	184.02081298828125
old pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in hand	150.42259216308594
bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinalist	134.49998474121094
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a dancer	156.8314971923828
at nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to arms	148.05747985839844
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton	67.86246490478516
he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen	116.51921081542969
well then speak  that which i have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my lord  leave us patrick said buckingham but remain within sound of the bell	153.57911682128906
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way	118.41622161865234
we are lost  no said felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard  then run to the door and open it yourself  felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul	158.4532012939453
three  and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle	210.54000854492188
i mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not by her infamy soil an unblemished name that she shall not with one blow dishonor her husband and her child  no nooh no  well madame it will be a laudable action on your part and i will thank you for it  you will thank mefor what  for what you have just said  what did i say	127.96656799316406
listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park	99.63959503173828
i believe the storm is over said he	159.50143432617188
it is he exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos it is he	66.07980346679688
what do you say of him	32.057884216308594
as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg	115.6627426147461
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land	185.0419464111328
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience i see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be aramis  it was indeed aramis	108.71121978759766
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him	175.81564331054688
tis a matter of conscience with them as with us  meantime here we are enemies said porthos	241.39842224121094
the place royalebe it so replied athos	65.38189697265625
the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo	107.25432586669922
then heres to our next merry meeting  adieu dear captain said porthos i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony  yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon	169.35362243652344
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos	64.71089172363281
why you strike like a blind or a deaf man  it was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours  oh mine replied dartagnan was not a man  what was it then  it was an apparition  and  i charmed it away  without further explanation dartagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the richelieu gate	140.16616821289062
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everythingkiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himselfat the first signal given by my father	145.2803497314453
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend	290.7755432128906
davrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning	76.39305114746094
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars	189.57989501953125
dartagnan did not know where he was and wished himself a hundred feet underground	110.1190414428711
say no more i entreat you	49.57521438598633
had dartagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character	122.06328582763672
if you have two coats you will give me one of them	47.96922302246094
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her selfpossession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now	182.43765258789062
my friend continued morrel you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waitingtoday is the fifth of october he took out his watch it is now nine oclocki have yet three hours to live  be it so said the count come morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it	113.61150360107422
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he saw	89.12435150146484
the blood no longer flowed from his wounds	72.22575378417969
i have it still  50235m    the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hôtel despagne	47.18915557861328
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father	82.24143981933594
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself  come come enough of such compliments cried porthos	233.05477905273438
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc dangoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home	156.14254760742188
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken	78.91278839111328
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground	105.49271392822266
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act	68.37879943847656
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes  it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshals staff to offer you  oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur	150.09115600585938
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants	224.29827880859375
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key	136.99021911621094
what fine things we would do together  yes said porthos	89.31362915039062
what do you wish gentlemen  who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone	82.43344116210938
here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork	185.27679443359375
one of the officers went to the place i directed	90.7964096069336
but dartagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it	103.76388549804688
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running	56.98701095581055
you may retire we consent to that	92.61895751953125
i am cold sir said mousqueton	4.553862571716309
kitty said he i will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like dont let that disturb you and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry	111.27298736572266
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner	294.6827087402344
athos stretched out his hand toward her	48.21508026123047
when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom  nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like  that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen	121.58091735839844
athos is so cool so brave and handles his sword so skillfully  no doubt	249.8238983154297
then said dartagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	299.6116027832031
without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured	247.01593017578125
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table	88.79437255859375
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions fear nothing there is a watch over you and if your wings like those of icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall  he then said something in arabic to ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance	215.4677734375
i shall know about that soon for i shall soon speak out to athos  day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the other	224.9866180419922
oh those figures how well i remember them	116.95624542236328
follow us planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village  they traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses  go then dear friend said aramis follow your own career	158.0929718017578
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in dartagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected	184.67559814453125
vitray said he you will go with all speed to london	76.36285400390625
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity  i ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy  that cannot be sire said the earl	146.48922729492188
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed him	98.89677429199219
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night	117.82127380371094
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow  felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her	328.4638671875
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely you are eating horse  eating what said dartagnan	239.12738037109375
since my brothers assassination in the streets of nîmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard	89.78804016113281
the evening was no longer joy but delirium	364.4333190917969
you make me young and happy again by it	191.87051391601562
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	154.9976348876953
this was julie who had become as the clerk of the house of thomson  french had predicted madame emmanuel herbault	79.72543334960938
i opened the door of the anteroom myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor  because i was shown up the private stairs  how so  i know not it must have been a mistake  mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make dartagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing	115.1354751586914
mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up	137.48355102539062
i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain i have punished him for his injustice that is all  de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such insensibility	183.2982177734375
i speak to you in french said dartagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language	100.14019775390625
trembling and awestruck caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth	147.1235809326172
it had long been an object of ambition for porthos	138.0786590576172

since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles  that is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste	280.88348388671875
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the momenta conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation	129.34910583496094
an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march	121.51692962646484
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him	500.2265930175781
yes  what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer	69.3718032836914
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice  thank you no sir  then it will be tomorrow  yes but without fail  ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified  i will come myself  better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands	171.26136779785156

if my mother could know of this attention on your partand i will venture to tell heri am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed	98.45270538330078

read the address  monsieur el comte de wardes  the remembrance of the scene at st germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon	77.31588745117188
it will be even more difficult to descend  dartagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	146.50662231445312
this method was so simple that dartagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively	341.7851257324219

in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person	164.8682098388672

he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	173.53929138183594
these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said monte cristo	46.46025848388672
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truthhe cared little for that  mene mene tekel upharsin  which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wallbut what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	286.7160949707031

then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the ministers cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free  it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the antechamber	129.72706604003906

the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose	100.89481353759766

you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others	82.53113555908203
at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips	102.2271957397461
life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach  well sir said danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled	246.31117248535156

allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries  at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris  and was this conference arranged beforehand  no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians  athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them	152.53713989257812

this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès	47.99955749511719
30083m    the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation	199.86500549316406
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action	242.4896697998047

thank god thank god  yes it is i said dartagnan it is i whom god has sent to watch over you  was it with that intention you followed me asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy	116.22749328613281

how inscrutable are the ways of providencefor what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased  dantès whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others	307.8945617675781

it was quite dark and no one saw them go out	193.07554626464844
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture	167.93653869628906
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing	163.62521362304688
come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it  oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet	152.5196075439453

the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention	76.47440338134766

bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening	85.98851013183594
some unknown enemyan invisible foehas done this  the more must you fortify yourself albert	514.8187866210938

yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us  but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors  bah	124.87246704101562
what interest have they in your death	67.57208251953125
our friends  are become our most dangerous enemies athos	358.2900695800781
what do you think dartagnan said athos	16.969867706298828
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance	186.2698974609375

she wouldnt believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb	121.7986831665039
dartagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket	181.5131072998047
but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them	190.5511016845703
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance  mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced dartagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself	233.9798583984375
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here	69.12052917480469
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise	74.24990844726562
my father said i was his joyyou style me your loveand both of you have called me my child  do you remember your father haydée  the young greek smiled	164.88668823242188
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return	76.11245727539062
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long  and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz dépinay	480.98431396484375
ah sir replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life  this is terrible said athos	175.7101287841797
as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	185.22891235351562
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville	170.993896484375
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	102.88876342773438

we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin  you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into  truly athos interrupted dartagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of	236.4799041748047
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward	146.93499755859375
kitty entered to bring some sherbet	149.44692993164062
yes and without violence said louise	42.51710510253906
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to dartagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed	198.83432006835938
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble	98.71331024169922
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon  as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself	120.26993560791016

can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	44.20274353027344
whom do i see yonder  where  in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a cloak  it is he cried dartagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man	112.61320495605469
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within them	153.7614288330078
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go  you are too late madame the orders are issued  well should he be arresteddo they think they will arrest him  i hope so  if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison  the procureur shook his head	250.7417755126953
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if i fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen	191.14462280273438
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villeforts room who had said she would receive them there	97.39936828613281
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty	144.30665588378906
what do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone	161.0107879638672

go to blin or véronique for your clothes	133.94419860839844
oh i cannot go without taking leave of her i cannot die without confiding her to someone  he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines  i bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahisand son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseillesthe sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brotherinlaw emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness	236.05516052246094
i have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day i will assist you	74.46316528320312
besides we are in a situation to overlook ceremony  come then let us go to your friends house	169.26336669921875

the young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of houdin and bethune	175.1270294189453
a cloud passed over his brow as he said  no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain	58.67894744873047
egad cried dartagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here  the devil said porthos in that case they have eaten everything  bah said dartagnan they will have left a chicken at least he dismounted and knocked on the door	91.0169677734375
sblood cried he to dartagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you	100.22274017333984
do not lie my angel said dartagnan smiling that would be useless  what do you mean	79.76498413085938
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention	142.0376739501953
ah if you could but help meif we could both together defeat their plan	507.114990234375
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report	135.4700469970703
with whomwith a child seven years old  dear friend at raouls age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real	409.8673095703125

yes my lord replied the servant m	144.45529174804688
i not only promise but swear it said monte cristo extending his hand	55.45474624633789
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which dartagnan had hitherto resided	236.61007690429688
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description	63.40415573120117
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions	83.21810150146484
as to the duc de bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the duc delbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff	121.22570037841797
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis	78.970458984375
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled	152.8899383544922
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events	309.5332336425781
his gravity made him look older than he was  well then if we can get athos all will be well	166.7098388671875
