get me out of this in heavens name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men  a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	94.28961181640625
dartagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence	56.6312255859375
now then all is agreed let us go down  you are going into the garden  yes  go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it  excellent thank you  and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	118.26685333251953
no madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you  20269m    yes i do remember replied the countess	60.05544662475586
this plan succeeded and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared	120.91149139404297
yes to a convent  and to which  i dont know the secret has been well kept  but  i  will know  and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is  i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal	73.02223205566406
alas i understand  think of the offense you have committed toward me madame	116.48694610595703
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni	39.88066482543945
this house is part of valentines marriageportion and m de saintméran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin  it was morrels turn to become pale	99.52359008789062
and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed	94.875732421875
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month	174.4014434814453
when they reached the street aramis said  well athos what do you think  of whom  pardieu	83.97560119628906
athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask assistance	234.9435577392578
so much the better  are we then to go to war  by my troth yes  against whom  are you a politician friend  not in the least  are you for mazarin or for the princes  i am for no one  that is to say you are for us	84.95764923095703
a capital blow you gave cried porthos	117.95697784423828
pardon meat least such i have heard is your custom  nay madame	416.13262939453125
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world these words carried a ray of hope into fernands heart	85.42294311523438
but in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship	133.41226196289062
do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness	78.3880844116211
there is halfpast ten striking albert  20243m    confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp	168.03074645996094
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment	74.292724609375
but i am grateful i swear to you  but what does this note contain  milady will tell you  ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched  to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women	106.42088317871094
i knew that from the mixture of greek words	153.87425231933594
my officer said athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness  go up said the host she is still in her chamber  athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat	142.1187744140625
the count received him with his habitual smile	29.87755012512207
then they looked at one another	88.66677856445312
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom	92.15859985351562
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down	73.61713409423828
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his	148.95211791992188
do you understand me he said	24.030925750732422
dartagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarkedfor nothing had led him to the examinationthat the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses	134.78948974609375
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him	83.96746826171875
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory	95.72490692138672
it must be nearly four oclock	60.93129348754883
monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there it is an affair of importance on the service of the king  the musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange	76.41738891601562
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	126.0201187133789
there is one thing only which i must request  what is it	80.32445526123047
provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall i send valentine to you the old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish	238.1360626220703
if an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed	31.762792587280273
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villeforts dressingroomi saw i tell you silently enter a white figure  valentine screamed	166.93328857421875
it was the duc de beaufort who was coming from the vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the parisians intoxicated with joy	35.396507263183594
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately	126.70992279052734
yes yes continued m de tréville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right for upon my honor it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court	88.86790466308594
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder	241.74562072753906
do not be angry we can try it caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut	75.29911804199219
will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it  elsewhere the count found everything he requiredsmellingbottles cigars knickknacks	122.16502380371094
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands	62.910682678222656
a great pity said monte cristo	31.654014587402344
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction	43.631317138671875
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day	125.6065902709961
the next day m noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	68.05651092529297
dartagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them	82.48624420166016
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty  monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal	212.91200256347656
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house	83.53890991210938
dartagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it	109.2854232788086
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost  to die whilst doing a good deed	88.10081481933594
dartagnan and the englishman  chapter xxxi	55.7663459777832
ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you	97.14449310302734
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated	166.2423553466797
i was sure of itthe cursed letter  dont be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure  ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps  well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed dartagnan i will go without you	170.53097534179688
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father	54.006736755371094
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged	103.8626480102539
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and customhouse officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	222.34136962890625
that would be too terrible  calm yourself sir replied de guiche	118.82817077636719
it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life	208.5122528076172
yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture  give me another cutlet  no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens  zounds	173.05076599121094
very well my lord it shall be so  dartagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarins flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness	179.18971252441406
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès	52.900482177734375
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre	94.79935455322266
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here  a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance	157.99493408203125
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson  french had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter	121.74700927734375
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent	153.67018127441406
give way  at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late	63.95000076293945
the anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	206.3024444580078
instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos i shall go and shoot on his estate	206.8875274658203
you played very willingly with us without knowing our names said athos by the same token that you won our horses  that is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our blood	203.75608825683594
yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth	135.6527862548828
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately	176.24490356445312
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village  curé	204.65846252441406
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying  here is the brazier lighted  there was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror	206.4210205078125
dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer	241.64695739746094
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade	72.0741958618164
there he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination morrels petition m de villeforts marginal notes	327.9197692871094
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but dartagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis	113.02253723144531
the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass	70.30838012695312
what can it mean said debray to franz	74.78655242919922
what with dartagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them	132.77362060546875
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	148.34523010253906
ah yes it is indeed strange  and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening	91.68250274658203
the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude	137.02764892578125
buckingham saw by the expression of the young mans face what was passing in his mind and he smiled	52.573360443115234
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him  wretch exclaimed haydée her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery	110.46082305908203
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devotee	121.77400970458984
now as a quarterpast one has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes mercédès will have become madame dantès  0069m    fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company	111.16416931152344
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere	40.11726379394531
where are you come from sir	98.33329772949219
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason  madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de larbresec and two at the door of your palacefifteen in all	61.40974044799805
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew	115.4862289428711
i have done and dartagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis	27.24131965637207
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saintméran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300000 livres	50.90279006958008
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one	51.19256591796875
let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her looks	218.46478271484375
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague	99.57157897949219
we can talk while performing that necessary task	564.5816040039062
at this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admirals ship where they had been obliged to seek him	85.95193481445312
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep  edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came	128.78616333007812
drink this and then take nothing more tonight  valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear	168.0301055908203
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet	41.00613784790039
for him those ten minutes were very long	257.16156005859375
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello	82.18907165527344
and now he said may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me  take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles  sire replied villefort bowing in an hour i shall have quitted paris  go sir said the king and should i forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection	93.43907928466797
demand anything you want and i will hasten to have you furnished with it  but i have neither my women nor my servants  you shall have all madame	118.76058959960938
the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began	71.86650848388672
in half an hour  the young man bowed	58.649410247802734
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven	190.8470001220703
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres	59.62731170654297
oblige me by taking a seat said dartagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sat down pale but calm	170.38369750976562
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage  what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants  it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino	131.9508056640625
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	301.2547607421875
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	112.66476440429688
every career is open to you	318.4602966308594
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs  on your kneeson your kneeshe is our benefactorthe saviour of our father	125.54688262939453
the queen entered and dartagnan remained at the door	26.94486427307129
better study a little common prudence	779.3893432617188
come answer frankly   ma foi  no returned albert	383.7556457519531
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass	95.43141174316406
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us  i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	116.75647735595703
i am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right  reassure yourself madame i will answer for the kings safety  as he left the queens presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	93.76874542236328
dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my fathers commands it is more on your account than my own  but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worstwhy picture so gloomy a future  because i judge it from the past  still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance	189.51220703125
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness	518.3577270507812
the peasants were in great commotion	126.6209487915039
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans  we have no need therefore to say that dartagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheardof things which were taking place	156.71136474609375
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service	40.915218353271484
at what age did you leave greece signora asked he	236.93499755859375
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends	112.75144958496094
the notary she exclaimed let him come in  the notary who was at the door immediately entered	118.90979766845703
your name  the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times  possibly madame	188.392822265625
madame resumed athos two of my friends named dartagnan and monsieur du vallon sent to england by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france no one knows what has become of them  well said the queen	102.70405578613281
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london	222.21566772460938
but then you yourself are known to others  yes i am known so that  proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti  so that you will remit to me these 48000 francs  certainly at your first request the majors eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment	174.02810668945312
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern	121.90357208251953
to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans	65.89117431640625
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them	244.67770385742188
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death	212.14747619628906
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me	182.51431274414062
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines  are you a surgeon asked de guiche	150.5198974609375
baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome	75.67922973632812

dartagnan was conquerorwithout much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for forms sake	200.73751831054688
be it then as you desire	81.84858703613281
madame more hopeless than he thinks	260.6931457519531
i do not say i regret no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be orthodox  the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven and the curate did the same	96.9002685546875
in losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from olivain the emotion his face might betray	132.23114013671875
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	129.8190155029297
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england	167.5700225830078
useless to look everything will come to us when wanted	354.2707214355469
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine	197.71783447265625
four young men of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world	110.11730194091797
milady was there as it were where you sit athos changed color	660.9486694335938

these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect	124.3789291381836

he walked six or seven times round the place royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in miladys apartment which was to be seen through the blinds	111.5074462890625
his two companions were already on horseback	40.3050537109375

and must i lose the one to save the other	86.65701293945312
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house	101.81980895996094
you have an excellent memory milady  but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france  the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness	181.8389892578125

the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte daix	205.59107971191406
the three friends looked on panting and astonished	97.460693359375
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head	67.04904174804688
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces	513.9053955078125
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken	78.05667877197266
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed  the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in  meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was	137.39364624023438

miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloudprayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere puritan	117.93616485595703
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis	234.15708923339844
albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult	329.80859375
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme	118.6136703491211
valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily  no pity procureur the crime is fragrant	263.8456115722656
woe to them if it be so  and he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the seine	152.55677795410156
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction	76.226318359375
he looked at alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it	123.27174377441406

you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	210.47425842285156
but nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the ministers secretary	190.89968872070312
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	123.09992218017578
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me  but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness  not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure	68.42292785644531
ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if i could but do as you do and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteaus successor  tis true my lord answered la ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent  in any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of monsieur de chavigny  well my lord said la ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them	147.99606323242188
on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment	68.74259948730469

fortunately deceived by dartagnans trick they neglected to reload their guns	357.4153747558594
the  cicerone  reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman	38.81318664550781

the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand	108.37970733642578
you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer  the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me	109.77192687988281
why the man must owe me a fearful grudge  does his action appear like that of an enemy  no certainly not  well then  and so he is in paris  yes  and what effect does he produce  why said albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle marss diamonds and so people talked of something else  my good fellow said châteaurenaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	132.9569854736328

but he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queens carriage had left the court	82.8536376953125
i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider	147.82200622558594
take this said madame de villefort giving her smellingbottle to valentine	65.06373596191406

the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent	288.2896423339844

if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon  and dartagnan dressed himself in an instant	71.96279907226562

it was a béarn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without windgalls on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a martingale quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day	297.4159851074219
such is the atrocious logic of revolutions	203.03384399414062
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen	138.8024444580078
well picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillcertainly frightful perhaps sanguinary  the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat	358.45361328125
and what else does your worship wish for  to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom  the viscount de bragelonne	76.30229187011719

if anything yet remains of that great that sublime king henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself  the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarins brow	203.42747497558594
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm	165.10618591308594
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that dartagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos	140.9727325439453
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted	119.09165954589844

all this will not advance your outfit said athos for if i am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you	66.74978637695312
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferryboats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to postparis presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions	235.08859252929688
a sort of smile played on his lips	79.67838287353516
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you	124.79359436035156
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word	116.43257141113281
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it  yes said danglars	98.79350280761719
all is over  but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king  an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss  did you not see his face asked athos	178.3055877685547
is he afraid of me or of his father	110.33080291748047
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding	122.81163787841797

except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction  his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here  they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europethe english the spanish and the german  the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed	169.40338134765625
dartagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side	90.95978546142578

then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends	59.30621337890625
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you  when  tomorrow  where  in my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest place  i will be there  at this moment madame de villefort approached	78.17323303222656

besides what is required of a young man in paris	49.83772659301758
he was a man of twentyfive or twentysix years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them	119.93067169189453
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards	389.2582092285156

but first of all i must get there  he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo	53.579078674316406
he had good cause to do so the pain i gave him must have been atrocious	144.57241821289062
porthos cried athos and laughed aloud	72.10338592529297
who is this young person m de morcerf inquired eugénie does anybody know  mademoiselle said albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversingthe young woman is a greek  so i should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as wellinformed as yourself  i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a  cicerone  replied morcerf but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have nothing further to communicateyes stay i do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count i heard the sound of a guzlait is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own  then your count entertains visitors does he asked madame danglars	141.81204223632812
this affair made a great noise	61.228050231933594

what more could the most devoted lover desire then he murmured the words of the english poet frailty thy name is woman  six months afterwards continued caderousse the marriage took place in the church of accoules  the very church in which she was to have married edmond murmured the priest there was only a change of bridegrooms  well mercédès was married proceeded caderousse but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart	137.80215454101562
i expected him this morning  he desired me to tell your grace replied felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle  yes i know that said buckingham he has a prisoner  it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace replied felton	82.1335220336914

nevertheless whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey she resolutely drew near to aramiss shutter and tapped at three equal intervals with her bent finger	204.95925903320312
there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices huntinghorns bassviols flutesa whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencilsfor music had been succeeded by painting foils boxinggloves broadswords and singlesticksfor following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandys education ie fencing boxing and singlestick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher	241.74134826660156

he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the illjoined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars	107.15418243408203
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening	30.87273597717285

aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him	175.47702026367188

now by way of having a restingplace during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookerywhich has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many yearsand obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name	276.9053649902344

valentine with her womans instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him	149.03858947753906
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger	101.13859558105469

athos and aramis kept themselves to their role	63.10639572143555
so much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets  i do not reproach you monsieur said dartagnan tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct  and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked aramis haughtily	78.65373229980469

what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness	112.73876190185547
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	50.954872131347656
dartagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between them	101.5255355834961

then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared	214.5385284423828
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse dartagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st germain	131.52784729003906
it is for a consultation which will last three hours at least	109.0073471069336

athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused	126.61763000488281

during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookerythat is the worst in the world	107.35589599609375

sit down there before me dartagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen standing and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed	97.39728546142578

i dont care to be shot in a box  no said aramis he has not seen us	69.95747375488281
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt	113.4578628540039

this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued	224.6475372314453

meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency  charles shook his head	252.62246704101562

my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity	279.5159912109375

madame de saintot has hastened to him with broth la renaudot warms his sheets the marquise de rambouillet sends him his tisanes  you dont like him my dear parthenie said scarron	184.8199005126953
everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its place	921.9578247070312
valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it	120.07350158691406
what is to happen said porthos	33.48587417602539
what must i do  above all things be always on your guard	141.68125915527344
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	57.99509811401367
he shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream	87.82675170898438
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis	202.05335998535156
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof	160.6970977783203
you think i shall deprive you of those three millions said danglars but do not fear it	52.1835823059082
this short interval was sufficient to determine dartagnan on the part he was to take	81.80082702636719
the handle of this saucepan was of iron dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it	90.99501037597656
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there	189.36993408203125
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers	159.2445831298828
i am a gentleman born and my blood is warm as you may have remarked my dear dartagnan	71.5271987915039
in whose name do you come said he to him	76.74519348144531
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arms around her neck	171.14691162109375
the count does not know  how should i know	43.3032341003418
oh pardon me sir i can scarcely realize so great a happiness	141.51455688476562
she took the risk upon herself	155.94752502441406
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie  be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious man	140.4999542236328
faith you are indeed right not to return to it	147.6029510498047
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first	134.96725463867188
however he remained standing clinging to a window	100.48257446289062
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master	127.01570892333984
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the counts visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders	125.81399536132812
at this moment planchet brought out athoss horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle	153.60153198242188
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead  do not think so bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watchcare to make of them instruments of his vengeance  so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again	135.47967529296875
i demand the suppression of the thesis  since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably	229.40866088867188
what shall we do said athos	36.19157791137695
went without recompense  the dukes endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the precautions taken at vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money	293.923095703125
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see dartagnan	130.8791961669922
when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips	160.85195922851562
i took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as i thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners  again said dartagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word  coiners	147.1366424560547
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m de tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment	32.4250602722168
let us drink  then she is dead stammered dartagnan	48.75348663330078
i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone  i suppose not	113.3069076538086
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt	285.59912109375
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captains feet	181.17552185058594
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation	200.47560119628906
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and dartagnan a captain	98.33723449707031
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier	86.02603149414062
the dappled grays  the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglarsa small octagonalshaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin	191.0703582763672
this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from her high estate  indeed  well my lord four men resolved to save her	201.92140197753906
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter	104.09160614013672
besides i am here in my own country and that excites me  and both with free use of the spur arrived at st omer without drawing bit	201.7206573486328
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner	309.4364013671875
you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse  yes truly dear friend and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay  and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly	108.85801696777344
my dear count allow me to show you the way they passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his place	85.687744140625
taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you	244.78285217285156
i am finishing the most execrable mornings work  what is it said albert arranging your papers apparently  my papers thank god nomy papers are all in capital order because i have none but m cavalcantis  m	332.31494140625
now that i have the word of athos i can set out  dartagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	101.6974868774414
dartagnan was over him at a bound and said to the englishman pointing his sword to his throat i could kill you my lord you are completely in my hands but i spare your life for the sake of your sister  dartagnan was at the height of joy he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face	99.42549896240234
the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century and in those times when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they cannot touch  edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and joy	238.6000518798828
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon	66.81057739257812
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain	152.8078155517578
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment  still my lord i cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and i cant travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts  mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to dartagnan  take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey  if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought dartagnan we shall yet be able to do business together he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	208.3599853515625
this was the last blow to the prisoner	44.289424896240234
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only servingman whom he had left	61.07895278930664
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september 1646	94.19258880615234
well dantès you do not thank me  this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only	81.1868896484375
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged	195.74197387695312
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident	819.1187744140625
valentine looked at m davrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room	63.59449005126953
stop and let us talk  talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos	109.80207824707031
four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table	160.68460083007812
my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation  you see cried dartagnan	144.46575927734375
we are friends are we not  egad	128.33251953125
you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed  yes  you are mistaken	145.84124755859375
they had not long to wait for an answer	79.30215454101562
the young man was opening the door of the stable	26.17721176147461
i present them but my correspondent has disappeared	222.47225952148438
oh cried porthos as if in pain	113.69501495361328
m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion  the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain	161.75338745117188
shall i send the father to you  immediately  very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a bankers wife should exercise in providing for the future	177.78778076171875
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to aramis and the third to porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance	162.9210968017578
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose  perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles	161.0194091796875
he jumped out of bed and ran to the window	29.786325454711914
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son	123.88262176513672
when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count  well i rely upon your promise	110.6204833984375
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence	159.2709197998047
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched	96.0710220336914
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage  the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris	127.26834106445312
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright	121.1948471069336
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her	142.0164794921875
you have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom i am obliged to live	184.52850341796875
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring	110.5030746459961
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	132.58010864257812
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words	138.85745239257812
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of dartagnan who however placed himself between him and them	145.15127563476562
the king went straight to him	32.91944885253906
so once more goodnight caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	234.75161743164062
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy	147.61830139160156
firstly at a given signal which shall be the words at last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you	305.6867370605469
cardinalists or frondeurs what matters it	135.6631317138672
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd	124.65692138671875
i am come sir to ask your advice  send directly to blois raoul or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself  raoul bowed	242.93943786621094
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades	154.49041748046875
the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery	177.0460968017578
have you been working all night	253.23814392089844
i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him  thanks monsieur returned monte cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre  is your steward also a nubian asked debray	316.4885559082031
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos	81.59591674804688
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune	108.19325256347656
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price  yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it  you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body	231.587158203125
why for him and not for me	87.89456939697266
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself  hear me count replied dartagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts  i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur dherblay	212.87596130371094
the count of monte cristo she murmured	27.78733253479004
no false modesty take the best horse you can find	337.1262512207031
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness	152.7924346923828
pardieu  said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels	300.86944580078125
horse said aramis with a grimace of disgust	95.66517639160156
la ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience	72.7125015258789
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped	110.05546569824219
all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again	152.38186645507812
we dined so very late hastily interposed la carconte	527.299072265625
who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty	306.7490234375
but at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken	351.2554016113281
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard	198.24319458007812
or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied athos	127.7668228149414
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone  and dartagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy	165.44419860839844
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is  then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentines room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a bloodred color	136.2548370361328
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please     chapter lxix	246.88723754882812
my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed	62.9117317199707
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion  on the honor of mazarin  i should like another sort of oath better said dartagnan to himself then aloud may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen  her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied mazarin go pray sir  one word more my lord if theres any fighting where im going must i fight  you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter  tis well said dartagnan holding out his hand to receive the money	155.2235870361328
let m de rochefort enter said mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced and beg m dartagnan to wait i shall have further need of him  these words gave great joy to dartagnan	204.5698699951172
dartagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts	177.70420837402344
they talk of making him an ambassador  30303m    and what are his claims to the peerage  he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the  siècle  and voted five or six years on the ministerial side  bravo viscount said monte cristo smiling you are a delightful  cicerone	213.05357360839844
i spurred on and found myself in the enemys ranks  and the prince was pleased with you  he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken	79.73954010009766
the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work	198.5216064453125
not the least in the world  oh you do quite right monsieur  but why this question  because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times  bah  preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guardi did not lose a movement of his features  and you found it  traitorous monsieur  indeed  still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction  it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us  monsieur jests but monsieur will see  what would you have planchet	163.9557342529297
count of morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer	126.19678497314453
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother	208.44296264648438
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned	183.08447265625
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared	102.02086639404297
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	112.58845520019531
no monsieur it is not aramis and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you  you pardon me cried dartagnan	83.1429443359375
and why if you knew me do you let me die  because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal	150.98548889160156
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	101.39655303955078
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life  a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès	231.0624542236328
the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help	163.83078002929688
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner  rapid as had been villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	210.4982452392578
do you know monsieur de rochefort  one of my bitterest enemiesthe faithful friend of cardinal richelieu  i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin	68.34444427490234
when dartagnan had finished he said hum	218.63558959960938
noirtier resumed m davrigny in the same pitiless tonem	66.98369598388672
on seeing him the regiment of corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered charenton flying	144.40487670898438
dont you say dear dartagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her  i believe so at least  in that case porthos will assist us  and how so if you please  why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	104.05677032470703
stop said albert here he comes	115.5372314453125
the rain of blood  as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glancebut there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened	128.9911346435547
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo	82.53719329833984
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear	171.894287109375
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not	41.66837692260742
my god  silence  both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking	453.50823974609375
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution  well then i will content myself with arresting you  madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament  it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and delbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him  your pardon madame i know all that	132.81655883789062
at length she murmured satisfied with herself come nothing is lost i am still beautiful  it was then nearly eight oclock in the evening	160.83078002929688
you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful armsthose lovely armswith large diamonds	262.70330810546875
i had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when i met friend danglars	130.6496124267578
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome  with pleasure  there was a cry of shut up from the audience	121.29983520507812
and so i did replied caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune	187.5296173095703

to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	272.2801818847656

but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming	169.49847412109375
its a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved	331.6102600097656

this is all very easy for you to say replied dartagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without resourcesfor me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet  this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair	252.8383026123047

bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband	127.70999908447266
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate	72.82027435302734
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such coldblooded policy  and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on alberts side	139.44931030273438
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain  the hostess who knew dartagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair	114.22793579101562

madame said villefort i ask where is m davrigny	53.6934700012207
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended  everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad	121.61802673339844
either you are a demon continued felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a monster	199.98370361328125
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least  do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end	105.17106628417969
he then began to ascend the path	77.43512725830078
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road  the devil he does	154.03854370117188
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a cry	102.0997085571289
and you are going to portsmouth  i have no time to lose	41.76093292236328

count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours  if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort	130.63504028320312
if the cardinal does not hold you in high admiration for the affair of london he entertains a great hatred for you but as considering everything he cannot accuse you openly and as hatred must be satisfied particularly when its a cardinals hatred take care of yourself	203.68138122558594
i shall use it again upon occasion  and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day dartagnan directed his course toward m de trévilles	106.91374969482422
there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he	32.08860778808594
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said m morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily explained  if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile i am the bearer of an order of arrest and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled	241.81707763671875
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentines powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old mans meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted	164.89730834960938
dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort	67.63490295410156

i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me	256.58050537109375
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on	124.27021026611328
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world	151.54940795898438
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sireit is the will of heaven  the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said  well what is to be done  sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely  winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours  sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked	111.84223937988281

cardinal i must have the queens papers  but how to take them sire	244.51138305664062
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so dartagnan saw that he became pale	92.57251739501953
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	172.3880157470703
after the king and the cardinal m de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens	92.65633392333984

as you will replied the duke	40.047523498535156

he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon	70.14817810058594
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw dartagnan who stood expecting her	110.92578887939453
open sir she said and look for yourself  mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze	286.85504150390625
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke thus	131.04612731933594
but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between luciens visit and the curiosity of the baroness	67.83092498779297
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away	192.21224975585938

your very devoted husband  baron danglars  the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his selfcontrol change color once or twice	545.07470703125

kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber	92.99906921386719
madame de saintméran wished her daughter should be married there	76.86063385009766

all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	86.80328369140625
this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your reason	300.5264892578125
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock	69.83616638183594
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed	81.7412109375
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	98.44974517822266
my fault said he you must be mad	53.10024642944336
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced	17.91621971130371
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past	162.54876708984375

the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	75.69518280029297

let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight oclock  a carriage was in readiness at the door	59.284019470214844
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to dartagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secretsonly she believed she could say she was not dead	108.45652770996094
all this negotiation must be carried on openly  i will follow your eminences instructions to the letter	150.67868041992188

how old was she  franz assured me replied albert that she was sixtysix years old	250.2713623046875

dartagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal	149.14430236816406
he clapped his hands three timesthe ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an echo	316.7311706542969

in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one	67.01123046875
scarcely had dartagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night	158.66452026367188
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad	251.05690002441406
now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error  there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors	88.63224029541016

four men surrounded him besides the postilion	149.38458251953125
five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered	116.88282012939453
at this very moment the court is making overtures to me hitherto i have repulsed them but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so ive a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now  accept it my lord accept it said aramis	107.31904602050781
do you think of dying my lord said she	36.44318389892578
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion	183.61489868164062
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the sergeant  and here i am said the sergeant	70.92645263671875
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château dif for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair  dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said  then you abandon all hope of escape  i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve  nay be not discouraged	225.43829345703125
you have done well to warn me	44.70534896850586

at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat	64.86278533935547
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for dartagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual	88.97926330566406
if you can my dear dartagnan answer for mademoiselle  oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris  then said aramis this falls out very well  he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty	85.69890594482422

the name of dartagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year 1634 or 1635 that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative  fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty	115.77481079101562

just reflect a little what an agitation the queens mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years  it is true said porthos	196.50564575195312
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles	155.06460571289062
this event might have three causes  the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majestys guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a wellfurnished purse in his pocket	68.53692626953125

during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath	213.61590576171875
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind	211.5087127685547
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses	336.6178283691406

why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with it  ah monsieur replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips  what the devil makes you think of bonacieux  monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will  because you are a coward planchet  monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a virtue  and you are very virtuous are you not planchet  monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder	161.45880126953125

the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues	50.84385681152344
if im not mistaken heres bazin	749.1805419921875
doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his breast	122.8106460571289
ah im ready to do what you will cried porthos even to swear by mahomet	196.8918914794922

i held the horses my hands were full your honor  a shot was fired that moment mousqueton shrieked with pain	262.47882080078125
but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp	248.41232299804688
oh  pardieu  less than nothing said aramis a charming little seamstress whom i love dearly and from whose hand i requested a few lines as a sort of keepsake  the duvil said the swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade  aramis read the letter and passed it to athos	157.5216064453125

the war with spain being ended fernands career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe	341.5577087402344
all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea  a pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercédès herself	104.91621398925781
cries of despair resounded on all sides	109.73356628417969

it was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in	83.16034698486328
the neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was over	139.8716583251953
there are your instructions said mazarin go  go	139.0615997314453
well well cried dartagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes porthos  yes said porthos but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep i think it is the wind  now climb up athos quickly said dartagnan	118.15862274169922
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation  why in truth sir was monte cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do	198.27249145507812
besides dartagnan has not told us his idea yet  and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast	107.20166015625
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion	142.2245330810547
i dont very well know what but still something  monseigneur said dartagnan this was what happened to me  never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it	94.3366928100586
0039m    ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then  meaning to say replied dantès with a smile which but illconcealed his trouble that if i were not a captain  eheh said caderousse shaking his head	93.8106460571289

when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom	99.40103912353516
he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since	59.708457946777344
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed	110.41543579101562
the world is not wanting in attractions	129.11721801757812
besides is he not a butchers son	152.3072509765625
athos muttered dartagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman	117.87477111816406
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated	755.6207885742188
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going   dentro la testa  answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture	121.47799682617188
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris	83.43830871582031
as for me i am sure of it said the duke	21.179901123046875
gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall	135.6234893798828
athos dwelt in the rue férou within two steps of the luxembourg	61.92680740356445
i do not know for i have never had it madame  have you any friends  i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where	76.06094360351562
a light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jailers	124.76580047607422
you see said he calling dartagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my domains  all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied dartagnan	121.76611328125
can tréville have set this gascon upon me	234.55850219726562
three of the four horses had already arrived	57.689029693603516
luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with	118.14059448242188
beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out and which were composed of fagots planks and empty casks heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art they found swimming in puddles of oil and wine the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole lefthand corner of the cellar and a tun the cock of which was left running was yielding by this means the last drop of its blood	142.45523071289062
then gloom settled heavily upon him	627.487548828125
yes you are at once from provence and spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan  it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness	173.8637237548828
i shall buy a chestnutcolored suit	82.98320007324219
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction	172.1851043701172
dartagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercers pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing	109.86717987060547
they had expected maximilian since the previous evening	71.01237487792969
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject	92.36959075927734
but said dartagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy  we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go  my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache thats a fair bet i hope  i take it said m de busigny so let us fix the stake  you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight	81.39613342285156
oh mercédès i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison	143.38238525390625
baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried beauchamp	368.52191162109375
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances  and now i am convinced said dartagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris  the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration	97.0141830444336
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina	101.20729064941406
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes  good he accepts said monte cristo	107.12863159179688
coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome spanish  genet  she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband	126.74532318115234
or the mysterious benefactress said athos	147.06727600097656
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs	58.7722282409668
but take no notice we know all about that  well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple  what asked dartagnan	72.51876831054688
how happy you are in being exempt from all this  well and why should not you be free too	136.89840698242188
dartagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad	131.3385772705078
the scheme goes forward it seems  on wheels dear friend  good	577.80126953125
it was now cromwells turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable	150.3787841796875
yes it is i my unclei the son of miladyi the monki the secretary and friend of cromwelli know you now both you and your companions  in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins	272.1048278808594
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to davrigny and said  and now the priest  is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked davrigny	119.1497573852539
but pray sit down  thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow	117.36031341552734
i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves	95.0949478149414
dartagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love	131.99427795410156
i want to know the route i am to follow said dartagnan	34.19380187988281
at the moment when the hand of the massive timepiece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door	134.40196228027344
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread	239.19171142578125
have you traded it for your diamond  no	137.48277282714844
are you sure of it  certain replied grimaud	71.50833129882812
will that satisfy you  must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey	257.07293701171875
i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked it	261.11474609375
here is madame returning with monsieur  dartagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos	104.57836151123047
dragoons swiss guardsmen musketeers lighthorsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends	208.11215209960938
however fugitive this homicide flash felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this womans heart	263.3478698730469
and as the man approached dartagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern	92.40430450439453
my father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joysaved you are saved and she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse	83.70243072509766
and therefore said dartagnan to clip the hope which athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity  if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty  why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us  noon the faith of a cardinal	136.7894287109375
oh muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond	85.88737487792969
one day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of frosinone	65.3525390625
but do you happen to belong to him  monsieur dartagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority	82.57659912109375

if we cannot we will do without him	60.09518051147461

for an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk	166.06663513183594

the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed dartagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthoss adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramiss had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead	90.12467956542969

he will come and visit the comte de la fere  dartagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward him	81.63319396972656
the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy	87.37416076660156

whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also	281.08831787109375
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece  peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french  speak italian sir	234.72039794921875
at this moment the door of the ministers box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats	104.40621185302734
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to dartagnan and a wellknown voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening  planchet cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	100.58804321289062
he began by asking m bonacieux his name age condition and abode	173.1019287109375

may i congratulate you  the affair is still in projection  and he who says in projection means already decided said debray	230.50428771972656

porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	175.87535095214844
that is not an answer replied athos	46.11261749267578
do not seek to know how i discovered it i know itthat is sufficient	68.15877532958984
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba  i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand  then did you see him edmond  who  the marshal  yes  morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly  and how is the emperor  very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him  you saw the emperor then  he entered the marshals apartment while i was there  and you spoke to him  why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with a smile	93.14836120605469
go on aramis go on  all at once a tall dark gentlemanjust like yours dartagnan  the same perhaps said he	152.7593536376953
but where you go i go  they then set off for rueil	129.43832397460938
this lad for he was scarcely a mansimple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked goodextended his affection even to his judge spite of villeforts severe look and stern accent	311.2679138183594
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as i have given you proofs my dear cousin i am not unskilled in such affairs and i will take charge of the commission	111.16358184814453
didnt you see that monsieur dartagnan mounted with difficulty	119.79264831542969
then as i believed my husband would be at home i hastened hither  to place yourself under his protection  oh no poor dear man	139.43017578125
tell me his name  edmond dantès  villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at fiveandtwenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch	244.0856170654297
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sons ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss	145.92568969726562
the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset  locked repeated mousqueton	341.9223937988281
i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her	186.09120178222656
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty	70.56065368652344
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	32.95738983154297
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lackeys  porthoss plan appears to me to be impracticable said dartagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you	195.9610595703125
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars	178.52354431152344
you are late  general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me  ah	81.76390075683594
we must extricate ourselves from this position  but how  listen	159.74697875976562
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible  possessed  that ever existed	108.97144317626953
what can he be looking for thought edmond	150.8586883544922
and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful  he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saintlaurent and advanced to the consigne it was the point where he had embarked	84.67847442626953

i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go  the count rang and a footman appeared	137.64341735839844
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton	85.22906494140625
ifaith said dartagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand	59.387542724609375
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive  dantès you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion  these words rang in dantès ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength	130.2562255859375
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret	190.87757873535156
it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants	93.47486114501953
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see	77.37788391113281
it happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	99.19871520996094
if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children	70.98251342773438
where then could he be if he had entered his mothers room and not since returned	112.59317779541016
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking	75.5608139038086

the morrel family  in a very few minutes the count reached no	116.93460845947266
then when de winter rose to take leave  listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband	103.63858032226562
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of  that is true said porthos echoing dartagnans sigh	115.47477722167969
and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he asked	221.6901092529297
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard	64.51688385009766
two months ago you were dying with hunger  the appetite grows by what it feeds on said caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling	185.88783264160156
this famous invention of yours  must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first  yes thats the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily	172.0189971923828
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton	208.5974578857422
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions	100.25032043457031
i know something of him  but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him  fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back tomorrow  which means that you now hesitate  no i do not hesitate god forbid	164.02745056152344
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands	95.93785095214844

he listened to know whence this sound could proceed	167.51170349121094

you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions	1357.5269775390625
undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office tomorrow  what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	125.03911590576172
you see someone pays me a visit	126.1568374633789

and i say that murders  are  committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months	220.25738525390625
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house  so that since that time replied dartagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host	136.80384826660156

whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry	177.2572784423828
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination	168.129638671875
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength	331.65106201171875

he put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning	86.12963104248047

i was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because monsieur laporte the queens cloak bearer is her godfather and befriends her  well monsieur asked dartagnan	272.6072998046875
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after	174.20330810546875

oh what a dreadful event cried maximilian	126.32376098632812
athos said she wait a moment  and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment	115.23099517822266
your hand athos  and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection m de tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that athos whatever might be his selfcommand allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was before	148.0672149658203

i thought i had been deceivedhad mistaken the spot	103.2833251953125
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale	301.772216796875
she had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman	236.3782196044922
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected	166.5783233642578
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do	52.073829650878906
scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba instead of making for marseilles direct  0025m    as to taking command of the vessel replied morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs  the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else  dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way  in a moment sir answered dantès and im with you then calling to the crew he said let go  the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porthole	201.48397827148438
why your protégé m andrea cavalcanti  ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m andreaat least not as concerns m danglars  and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it  what do you think he is paying his addresses  i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions	233.62411499023438

although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all dartagnan wished	289.3060607910156
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him	103.39188385009766
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child  here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted	331.3269958496094
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at dartagnan who was counting on his fingers	154.61253356933594
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness	69.0870132446289
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say  dartagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question	93.69115447998047

it is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful	44.701072692871094

the abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away	171.97323608398438
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry	199.34222412109375
the dailyrenewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeera service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy	97.74244689941406
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years  then no misfortune has happened to you  and what misfortune could happen to me	64.08238983154297

richest my dear fellow  and dartagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket	46.534820556640625

you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you  yes sir answered raoul	95.2822265625
there only they explained to them the matter in hand	146.22891235351562
he found him kneeling before a  priedieu  with his head leaning on an open prayer book	141.152587890625
next morning dartagnan was the first to rise	73.81953430175781
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand	81.46260833740234

dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror	138.57791137695312
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him	64.07221984863281
0263m    if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the gravediggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	120.04802703857422
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty	69.9377670288086
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers  all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest	115.40546417236328
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio	82.3374252319336

on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully	198.1162872314453
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet	62.094757080078125
as for myself i neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of athos who has none any more than i have  but what the devil	174.33343505859375
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	186.8176727294922
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip	121.47312927246094
goodday commander  ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him	155.30221557617188

at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil	97.97604370117188
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little amusement	237.99417114257812
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die  take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance  who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud	152.1099090576172

let us dispatch said the duke	30.90350341796875
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea	179.07798767089844
0329m    but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention  and so he was murmured caderousse	99.49655151367188
what an appetite you used to have	265.51611328125

besides it doesnt concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon  ah that is true said athos	116.92790985107422
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber	106.97071075439453
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner	42.41582107543945
but there must be some cause for this strange scene  the count of morcerfs adventure exasperates the young man  have you anything to do with it  it was through haydée that the chamber was informed of his fathers treason  indeed said morrel	102.14314270019531
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great however my mother had still some hope	336.8373107910156

monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majestya dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son	113.59178161621094

but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy	99.0627670288086

at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people  at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind dartagnan	116.61293029785156
and does he not live in the champsélysées  yes no	68.64347839355469

but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	78.10728454589844

but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not	91.27169036865234
i say that he has hastily accused your majestys musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources  the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself	124.70394897460938
i will go by the way of boulogne to clear the way athos will set out two hours after by that of amiens aramis will follow us by that of noyon as to dartagnan he will go by what route he thinks is best in planchets clothes while planchet will follow us like dartagnan in the uniform of the guards  gentlemen said athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair	118.16030883789062

porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern  light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling  then addressing dartagnan  you know the watchword he said	119.9944076538086
he felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition teresa might escape him	247.19398498535156
where is your master  you monsieur dartagnan cried grimaud impossible  grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak  ah monsieur it is  silence  grimaud contented himself with pointing dartagnan out to his master with his finger	146.05572509765625

the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st sulpice or from the rue du vieuxcolombier to the luxembourg	181.53369140625

one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might	136.985107421875

this letter as he spoke maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the countthis letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry  monte cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight	86.6695327758789
leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room	34.419273376464844

you have made up your mind at last my lord said rochefort	41.95074462890625
what is he going to do thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions were	262.88214111328125
the moment you leave me valentine i am alone in the world	34.05839157104492
on the following morning at five oclock dartagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mothers recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor dartagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow	192.4221649169922
and pray what was this quarrel about  these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door  force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose  to do her violence without doubt said athos	146.16859436035156
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	188.70236206054688
your song is as dismal as a de profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out  silence then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton	289.208984375
i have never been understood and no wonder	88.82723999023438
yes  must i leave alone  no  whom am i to take with me	209.05722045898438

albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments	121.78730010986328
for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die  danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers	215.3054962158203
i swear to you i protest  oh but god is above	103.08583068847656
my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it  yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it  still by one of your forty methods your highness  yes yes indeed  my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness  willingly answered the duke give me the pie  i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste	121.05184173583984
you are abused sir but that is not the question	53.463687896728516

a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you  but from whom is that letter  oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding  grisette  from madame de chevreuses chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchesss coronet  what do you say  hold	159.88804626464844
onlythe felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and groslow and his three sailors were consumed	58.13680648803711
heyday cried dartagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken	158.6114959716797
adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death	107.21500396728516
formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request	321.6275329589844
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may	79.89456176757812
who should it be but he who watches while i sleep who labors while i amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroadin france as in europe  your majesty probably refers to god said m de tréville for i know no one except god who can be so far above your majesty  no monsieur i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only friendof the cardinal  his eminence is not his holiness sire  what do you mean by that monsieur  that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals  you mean to say that he deceives me you mean to say that he betrays me	118.45796203613281
if a question in heraldry were started athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom their genealogy their alliances their coats of arms and the origin of them	169.8948974609375
well said gondy have you kept your word with me  not exactly replied the mendicant	82.75930786132812
everything conspired to prove to dartagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened	73.88475036621094
villefort again groaned with anguish and despair	363.4337463378906
what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other	77.67788696289062
you see it is yourself who have first named heryou her father  have pity on valentine	200.8667755126953
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove  everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak	119.1630630493164
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking	35.51212692260742
do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were  oh	94.4957504272461
i had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the place of another prisoner that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château dif and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers	90.35479736328125
ah said dartagnan i did not see that it was the sword of the comte de wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the breast  you are wounded asked buckingham as he opened the letter	53.685237884521484
i am tired cried dartagnan sitting down	49.94017028808594
but what do i see in the watersomething struggling  oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider  they are sinking cried olivain in his turn	103.69335174560547
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	132.3275909423828
who would ever have thought it  dartagnan only sighed	207.33717346191406
ah you are there said she at length turning towards fernand	72.4124755859375
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand	162.81082153320312
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key	95.64337921142578
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it	191.28065490722656
while exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants	541.6644897460938
the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl	98.8759765625
this time kitty was nowhere waiting for him neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great door	147.25384521484375
morrel you are going to destroy yourself  indeed count said morrel shuddering what has put this into your head  i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands	96.18915557861328
the sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him	94.09732818603516
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel long live the coadjutor  long live the queen cried de gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness	241.14486694335938
see look at fernand and follow his example he is wellbehaved  0051m    fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	181.65673828125
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest  you will hear me to the end my lord	99.04145812988281
the king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen	123.54337310791016
you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse	88.97539520263672
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding	112.21178436279297
but on my soul it looks so	180.71072387695312
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy	278.6029052734375
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed  unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke  this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects  oh my lord my lord  that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public  but your honor will soon be called so generally  i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	201.262939453125
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know  i have enemies replied dantès my position is not sufficiently elevated for that	118.2607650756836
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention	182.1248321533203
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by dartagnan  all for one one for all  thats well	293.4812316894531
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised winters head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast	86.98995971679688
it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested enduseless injury is repugnant to every mind	264.721435546875
besides even you didnt recognize me they will be much less likely to  that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you	106.30062866210938
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled	298.56268310546875
and dartagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected	152.51873779296875
do you doubt my word he said	45.30204391479492
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance but his father a sun  pluribus impar  left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers	154.8585968017578
suppose i happen to strangle him  to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world but you will not do so i hope	79.11907958984375
hes not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite  my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do	221.1420440673828
i cannot stop a moment i must start for paris again immediately  what	108.02617645263672
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile	143.1554412841797
what shall i say to the cardinal  you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battlefield that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay and of surrendering only to fifty men	94.8878173828125
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m de wardes	54.01544189453125
very well cried dartagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die  only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner  pooh	219.33322143554688
the abbés chamber  after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbés cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees	182.4630584716797
come in tréville  the duke saluted and retired	77.26318359375
permit me then my dear athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to m planchet  ah monsieur le chevalier said planchet bowing	141.02456665039062
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer	93.89742279052734
come hither i say and dont be afraid continued athos	213.2718048095703
he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his clerks	84.40470886230469
come louise let us talk of our affairs	82.44117736816406
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil d  they went to rueil cried aramis	128.1380157470703
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	98.68785095214844
no my lord and i will set out at once	38.405147552490234

has the queen any further commands for me now asked dartagnan	204.14791870117188
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is  alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again	71.6197509765625
0073m    how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is about caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared	103.54808807373047
here they are monseigneur  there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it	102.62211608886719
i am like nero cupitor impossibilium  and that is what is amusing you at this moment	41.990169525146484
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that  however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations	209.98155212402344
30221m    is it not so asked monte cristo	24.390914916992188
ah may you be a true prophet said dartagnan laughing	72.3036880493164
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever	140.4449462890625
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger	107.82881164550781
he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders go and fight and you go there	191.32135009765625
give him some more wine fernand fernand filled caderousses glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass	138.75035095214844
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business	138.26512145996094
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides	280.3035888671875
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman	113.36408996582031
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again	43.00663757324219
ah ah said he what does this mean  this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to dartagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture	39.84569549560547

out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained	233.21495056152344
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé	275.8482971191406
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay	46.77644729614258

albert besides being an elegant welllooking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscounta recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris	212.45704650878906

no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise  monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window	125.81429290771484
besides i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love	288.62030029296875
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me i only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark	110.13642120361328
without doubt aramis is one of my best friends  aramis	143.7377471923828
and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts  do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied athos	87.79190826416016
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at dartagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfellowship	54.639610290527344
say it then if i am in fault i will avow the error  the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated him	183.48089599609375
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say  yes sire  you will accept his judgment  undoubtedly  and you will submit to the reparation he may require  certainly  la chesnaye said the king	85.94341278076172
what have you to say in your defense asked bradshaw of the king	65.26798248291016
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own affairs	105.6509780883789
caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate	387.65655517578125
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the army	62.037315368652344
i say  there  for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there	321.0559997558594
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise  that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	187.39195251464844
the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge	95.30094146728516
now jump down athos  athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall	54.99452590942383
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort	55.51932907104492
did you come here to fetch me	68.8357925415039
are you not a sportsman and a great wolfhunter	36.73160171508789
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment	110.09856414794922
hush said the captain it is a fire  but you told me the island was uninhabited  i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers  and for pirates  and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franzs words	212.86216735839844
you  yes  you have them  i have them  ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48000 francsah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them  i do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything but happily the abbé busoni thought for you  he is an excellent person  he is extremely prudent and thoughtful  he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you  here they are  the major clasped his hands in token of admiration	124.5496826171875
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed from m de trévilles tone of voice that he was very angry about something	143.4088592529297
i enclose a draft for 5000 livres payable on m ferrea banker at nice and also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo whom i have directed to supply all your wants	117.29446411132812
where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon  i was within two paces of you monsieur replied the procurators wife but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water  porthos pretended to be confused	98.75196838378906
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you	27.45987319946289
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray	138.27139282226562
that is the least we owe her  thats true said athos but that concerns aramis  well replied the latter blushing what must i say  oh thats simple enough replied athos	169.44749450683594
m de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio	59.36543273925781
it is god himself who sent us here  yes said porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him  no replied dartagnan no noise	108.30845642089844
for one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as i die	119.46630096435547
come take a little oath for me on the cross i wont ask anything more of you  on the cross cried i rising for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength on the cross i swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth	243.5267791748047
what else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen  and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans  he went before i came down  let us go the same way we will stop at la réserve and we can drink a glass of la malgue whilst we wait for news  come along said caderousse but you pay the score  of course replied danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses	114.10997009277344
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population	171.04322814941406
who prepared it  the chemist who came here with me  40116m    drink it said the doctor to barrois	172.5539093017578
0059m    when one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him	112.98562622070312
it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis	30.52442169189453
i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king  yes madame but on the frontier he was met by lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings	127.18982696533203
the camp had entered saint omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen	86.62395477294922
but i require three weeks preparation at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please  three weeks cried albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor  had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir  well let it be three weeks then said morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in  m	159.0660858154297
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts	186.52223205566406
a paper may be lost  you are right only let me know where to find you that i may not run needlessly about the neighborhood  thats correct wait  do you want a map  oh i know this country marvelously  you	187.9297637939453
marie michon   oh what do i not owe you aramis said dartagnan	74.26870727539062
are you an angel and the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before monte cristo with indescribable terror	113.54136657714844
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it  but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me  30101m    this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	116.70170593261719
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service dartagnan  i shall be grateful to you all my life  very well	134.03761291503906
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn  but of what sort  eh	188.97105407714844
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	163.76400756835938
left alone dartagnan read and reread his billet	314.1975402832031
ah you speak spanish  enough i think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this occasion  meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place	126.6504135131836
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach	285.3731384277344
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	156.8360595703125
i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me	96.53118896484375
the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard	107.42420196533203
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise	151.79327392578125
my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired	184.23776245117188
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger  while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow	99.0087890625
this time dartagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse was	150.55162048339844
i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur demery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity	130.1954345703125
what a devil of a face you have porthos	119.2726058959961
the lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twentyfour hours the bite was mortal	219.39137268066406
those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with terror	313.3319091796875
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the sidegate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the champsélysées	153.3003692626953
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found anything  however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act	145.83010864257812
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	103.79877471923828
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy  but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted	129.9097900390625
except your signature and your partners m morrel  and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience  a cloud passed over danglars brow	140.7157745361328
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us  ah monsieur stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had  how sirrah	258.8734130859375
i am sure of itthey would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step	152.77633666992188
the title attracted me i took them home with me with the permission of the guardian and devoured them	189.93441772460938
you are not convinced yet  i hope at least that you may be mistaken  shall you see the king again  perhaps  would you pass in his eyes for a prophet  prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father  true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man  well what should i say to the king  say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble	159.82432556152344
what could she have done to you	55.99577331542969
i have sent for one replied the abbé	33.61808776855469
keep that ring for love of me	186.29476928710938
i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult	136.3597412109375
a man of from thirtyfive to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style	106.25228881835938
today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony	532.118896484375
but i cant be severe with him he is really  so  bright  after the usual civilities the count inquired after m de villefort	162.80731201171875
they have some capital wine hereplease to observe that in passing	194.85726928710938
oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there	173.46127319335938
i take them said dartagnan for myself	53.352561950683594
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter	60.662872314453125
in fact the blow was direct and severe	181.41090393066406
your history is a terrible one mr mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an allpowerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information  my lord to a wellbred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other  but this relation you mentioneddo you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwells person	144.24850463867188
but lord de winter might suspect him felton himself might now be watched	287.0177307128906
ah what is that cried the brigadier	38.306427001953125
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned	213.9447784423828
you have purchased it dearly enough  dartagnan left athoss chamber and went to that of porthos	150.5457305908203
on these days he spoke a little	95.21990966796875
he has such a short neck said she	141.39698791503906
i will not miss you  if i give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword	84.97317504882812
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	50.4600830078125
dartagnan is for mazarin he said to himself	79.90933990478516
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse	19.958614349365234
suppose that the supreme being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was goodsuppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal nighttheneven then mercédès you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment  mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude	193.021240234375
he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for	133.83157348632812
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas  this wound my dear dartagnan has been a warning to me from heaven  this wound	136.2567901611328
this was alberts favorite lounging place	848.9338989257812
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time  however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison  no sir not at this moment at least  sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	139.82737731933594
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while  at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp	79.2004623413086
did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder no i said very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn  but father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping  i do not understand you  you rely on the usurpers return  we do  you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast  my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble on the 10th or 12th he will be at lyons and on the 20th or 25th at paris  the people will rise  yes to go and meet him  he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him  yes to escort him into the capital	134.82992553710938
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince  but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal  oh oh said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	73.02838897705078
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen	151.6585693359375
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out to arms	94.14652252197266
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès inquired the abbé of caderousse	154.2286834716797
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical	537.0477905273438
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio  oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i cannot remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold  that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all  no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that planetree	65.28709411621094
no no i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say	147.51956176757812
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured	224.0494384765625
he was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms	200.81228637695312
where am i exclaimed she and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm  madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings  my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady	284.745849609375
heres one your honor  how the devil hast thou two horses asked dartagnan jumping on one of them	268.77099609375
wait  how long  i must calculate our chances i will give you the signal  but you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you	63.362056732177734
listen my dear my adored valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each others hearts	287.18243408203125
you were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to fly	145.09121704101562
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair  m	129.87796020507812
wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us  such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it  but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle dorleans was spoken of said de winter	139.82884216308594
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man  possibly thought dartagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarins compliment	99.81739807128906
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos	79.56896209716797
you have a good memory repeat what i have told you	60.61634826660156
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head	190.77174377441406
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented	90.30022430419922
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres	162.79397583007812
order it as you please sire you possess the right of pardon  the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty said tréville who was determined to have the last word and my musketeer is innocent	139.7681884765625
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears	174.89688110351562
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart	23.693708419799805
will they never bring that emetic asked the doctor	244.51919555664062
i dont want any supper said caderousse	70.15440368652344
but you my dear dartagnan  what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said dartagnan	49.813575744628906
draw if you please and instantly  not so if you please my good friendnot here at least	102.76764678955078
i have no influence with any one	64.99092864990234
mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing returned	173.88710021972656
have you not yet divined who he is  what cried felton heagain healways he	118.26939392089844
i saw him yesterday your friends lackey was leading him do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles yes	111.45449829101562
that mood lasted some time but now hes as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing  and du vallon asked athos	379.4012451171875
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas	158.37017822265625
patrick soon caught the sound of his masters voice calling his falcon	185.78353881835938
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed	36.42262268066406
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	98.617431640625
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	81.02496337890625
how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons  sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least  we shall see	112.96359252929688
the young man burst into a laugh	39.228546142578125
whatafter the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing	109.45079803466797
and now eat and drink i will entertain you tonight	95.86711120605469
i thought you would never come in  whats the matter now planchet demanded dartagnan	156.4444580078125
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles	78.13350677490234
theres nothing to do in paris now theres no fronde	278.0832824707031

down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible	140.1039581298828

however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money  then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies  apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants	122.39591979980469
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	51.42644119262695
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	101.08131408691406
it would be impossible to describe mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men	57.93962097167969
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine	70.69892883300781

no it has been stolen from you  stolen	95.85294342041016
i knight you monsieur le comte  then turning to aramis he said  it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier  the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king	138.14419555664062
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne	70.22743225097656

rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur dartagnan	42.438636779785156
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups	461.8074645996094
goodevening comrade said dartagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner	74.0031509399414
de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room	60.307979583740234

well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose	254.87429809570312
remained alone and turning his eyes on his halfopened horace muttered   justum et tenacem propositi virum   m de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kings authority	92.61079406738281
give me some water and ether	121.56937408447266
you were you know how i settled the matter  did he die  i dont know	114.71817016601562
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not  come  out of it but  fly  like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings that is to say patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks	132.00567626953125
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity  but if he had escaped  impossible my precautions were taken  and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him  the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me  and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done  it is possible	103.41259002685547
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday	422.9418029785156

well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart	81.70072174072266
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below	90.86965942382812
he again struck it and with greater force	117.95236206054688
then turning toward the second musketeer dartagnan said  monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety  the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready	134.9795379638672
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them	227.17739868164062
come in my host  now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen  better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself	181.45079040527344
andrea felt his heart leap with joy	105.49150085449219
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom	112.89380645751953
you  to interminable ineffaceable infamy  you repeated i oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad	164.81680297851562
your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer i have my answer ready  the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu	109.2004165649414
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag	130.48524475097656
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth  a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlets stood on end and racked with fury he cried out  silence sir	202.08042907714844
you were deceived sir i was not praying  do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator	91.71472930908203
he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of enghien	88.03424835205078
thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice 150000 livres per annum from the day i was married	131.65541076660156
vitray said he you will go with all speed to london	36.26660919189453
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections	203.37374877929688
he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy	110.14225006103516
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them	217.3702850341797
yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him	87.95067596435547
you must do so  certainly sir but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of god  well then sire continued dartagnan listen to the noise of the people you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder  in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze then all at once it ceased	91.19721221923828
on the evening of the twentyfifth as they were entering arras and as dartagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris	59.4503288269043
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain	119.7477035522461
the door opened and a dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand	113.70179748535156
really i never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion  debray smiled	175.1779022216797
at this instant the door opened	20.92203140258789
madame de villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared	72.87484741210938
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was dartagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you	70.1067123413086
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages	106.6697769165039
for in truth i think i have hitherto been deceived in you	85.4375228881836
the vendetta  at what point shall i begin my story your excellency asked bertuccio	139.32443237304688
they are the spoils of victory  i the heir of an enemy said athos for whom then do you take me  it is the custom in war said dartagnan why should it not be the custom in a duel  even on the field of battle i have never done that  porthos shrugged his shoulders aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos	67.94927978515625
we have promised and we will keep our promise	50.096309661865234
i always knew you were a good son  and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is  well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately  yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room  that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence  dantès smiled	89.05621337890625
by my soul said aramis she is charming	64.92813873291016
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension	249.8243865966797
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended	200.2393341064453
moses the servant of godhe was but a servant please to understandmoses blessed with the hands he held out both his arms while the hebrews beat their enemies and then he blessed them with his two hands	115.71978759765625
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which i consider quite beneath me	118.56917572021484
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart	79.84146881103516
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos	99.72667694091797
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir	285.24853515625
it was mercédès leaning on her sons arm and leaving the house	71.06267547607422
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice	120.68373107910156
the dinner  it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the diningroom	78.553955078125
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling	177.15521240234375
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable  hold your tongue	122.506103515625
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours	141.8142852783203
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition  oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize	115.10819244384766
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungryvery hungry  and your excellency wants something to eat  at once if possible  nothing easier said peppino	94.91790008544922
god is wearied he has punished you  caderousse was fast sinking	255.7598876953125
aramis cried athos dont fire  ah	269.8473815917969
are you making a sketch after poussin  oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort	231.8114471435547
by men of heart i mean men of courage	230.45703125
dartagnan went last still shaking his head	127.63644409179688
danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty	41.89271545410156
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol	63.03469467163086
it was situated in a very private spot	49.641517639160156
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing	185.60360717773438
there said dartagnan this is capital	98.47129821777344
the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles	77.15597534179688
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet dartagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme	99.5177993774414
what is there then behind this wall	99.41748809814453
why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than thatfor a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head	144.47354125976562
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey	105.03309631347656
it was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died  and what did you do then  what i ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place	53.751285552978516
i dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated	146.10678100585938
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger	109.91093444824219
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship	124.03943634033203
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	117.37223052978516
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truthhe cared little for that  mene mene tekel upharsin  which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wallbut what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	215.75460815429688
the fact is said dartagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment	172.59463500976562
and here is andrea cavalcantis baptismal register given by the curé of saravezza  all quite correct  take these documents then they do not concern me	186.76181030273438
valentine tell him if you love maximilian  the count felt his heart dilate and throb he opened his arms and haydée uttering a cry sprang into them	131.17202758789062
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing  what are you saying asked the queen	108.09444427490234
we need not add that the goldsmith oreilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any pretext	145.1669921875
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you cant refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea	218.39749145507812
well then off to the nearest goldsmiths and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him	105.80318450927734
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan	46.18916702270508
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name  and therefore said dartagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé dherblay	94.63116455078125
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france	62.03190231323242
let the civil war last but one year and i will have a constables sword gilt for me  and for me put in porthos	206.59295654296875
since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all	53.969085693359375
it was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the shortlived satisfaction of his own curiosity	109.66268920898438
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand	65.5367431640625
dartagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	127.72479248046875
come my friends  a moments delay said athos our servants  here we are they cried	156.68081665039062
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her	119.69501495361328
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back	77.86329650878906
do you find yourself badly lodged sister	254.69158935546875
hes heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head	208.9260711669922
i do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king	35.64764404296875
often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de beaufort	86.29505157470703
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me	140.26565551757812
let us wait and as i said before let us speak of yourself	55.161293029785156
dartagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake	114.26084899902344
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land	155.03517150878906
the result was that when the newcomer left the hotel with the  cicerone  a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers and without having been seen by the traveller and appearing to excite no attention from the guide followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used	104.69622039794922
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse  but he will not wish for only one harness  stake both  pardieu  i am not selfish as you are  you would do so said dartagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself	148.1617889404297
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe	87.63406372070312
he looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its nail	112.5205078125
i raised my head i was in utter darkness	81.46959686279297
i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and calais	311.5050354003906
planchet said dartagnan to his domestic who just then insinuated his head through the halfopen door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine i prefer that  ah ah	111.17079162597656
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department	95.46022033691406
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed	176.3574676513672
well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy  it drives me to despair said fernand	104.42394256591797
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i havent seen what does not concern me but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers and he added turning to porthos heres a gentleman whos of the same opinion as myself  porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture	132.37271118164062
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m de morcerf and is justified by his son	32.47119140625
cant you guess my dear athos	126.03699493408203
yes if you really wish it said dartagnan and even with great pleasure i confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite  ah my poor friend said aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected  am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur  oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers	134.2390899658203
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any waythat is if he approved of the person proposed	100.9384536743164
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return  stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here	311.1674499511719
my dear albert said debray rising it is halfpast two	77.63052368164062
and pray what do you call such an action  but who said it was buried alive  why bury it there if it were dead	176.11141967773438
alas do you love nothing else in me asked dartagnan	64.95025634765625
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saintméran	86.31492614746094
oh sir reply i entreat youis not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember handsome and brave a musketeer under louis xiii who must be now about fortyseven or fortyeight years of age  yes sir you are right in every particular  and who served under an assumed name  under the name of athos	106.0478515625
diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now  then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinals door	153.28961181640625
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	239.59854125976562
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsdaume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project	230.64328002929688
and when did you arrive here inquired she	121.26219177246094
porthos wept aramis pointed toward heaven athos made the sign of the cross	137.14923095703125
dartagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet	99.73614501953125
here are thirty francs i will sleep at the  cheval rouge  and will secure a place in the first coach	124.22862243652344
dartagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive	97.77848052978516
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire	127.2318115234375
go upstairs she said to the doctor	80.9541015625
and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile  madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties  so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse	108.7349624633789
adieu then till we meet again said valentine tearing herself away	244.82801818847656
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	114.51453399658203
50183m    are you looking for anything mr procureur asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile	157.6376190185547
dartagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m de tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens	64.19019317626953
sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime  say absurd since it has become useless	194.8479766845703
what interest have they in your death	240.9580841064453
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests	97.26978302001953
my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around	85.59851837158203
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering	172.71237182617188
mine was carried away by a ball	104.61801147460938
while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos	172.41909790039062
you must dress yourself raoul said athos i am going to present you to some one  today monsieur asked the young man	50.92180252075195
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say goodbye to you in full dress noirtier again closed his left eye	176.19659423828125
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal	69.54840850830078
he was des roches le masle canon of notre dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his eminence as a perfectly devout man	153.99264526367188
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule dartagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain lauxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy	44.05573272705078
about five minutes replied the captain	69.22584533691406
the result was that to prevent mm	101.20858764648438
perfectly well quite rested sir  you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth	390.31597900390625
notwithstanding all the pains he took dartagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three newmade friends	208.25747680664062
when the soldier saluted charles athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket	284.208251953125
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse  the three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances	122.68018341064453
justice before everything  then turning toward m de tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window well monsieur continued he you say it is his eminences guards who have sought a quarrel with your musketeers  yes sire as they always do  and how did the thing happen	149.4964599609375
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known	174.99996948242188
villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper	98.58480072021484
you will in turn enter it my dear dépinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family	69.25860595703125
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	271.9683532714844
dartagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week	239.1180419921875
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest	120.7929458618164
sir said davrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened	406.3219909667969
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan	264.5707702636719
around the schooner lay a number of small fishingboats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen	321.83154296875
will that do  my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the greeks  well then said athos it is agreed	156.1525115966797
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him	141.5348663330078
franz thanked the count for his attention	76.69135284423828
bonacieux but why then did you cry out so  do you not understand said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind	137.59957885742188
she went to the palais replied the steward	52.22059631347656
the two musketeers met at the gate	23.05161476135254
i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned itwithout any fault of mine i can honestly declare	383.0021057128906
but instead of growing easier dantès pains appeared to increase in violence	492.9423522949219
you are insupportable cried the duke i shall beat you  grimaud bowed	73.75542449951172
i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions	91.10807037353516
do you wish to go to m danglars	17.033645629882812
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story  well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp châteaurenaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast  gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else  ah true a diplomatist observed debray	161.05393981933594
oh attend to it valentine i entreat you  but no said valentineno i tell you it is all past and it was nothing	67.33704376220703
that is of the first importance  attend to it then at once  unfortunately it is a thing that i cant perform at any time i choose	124.78699493408203
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied dartagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed	76.94497680664062
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room	126.77911376953125
dartagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed	286.7437438964844
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him  what did you refuse to dine with him said old dantès and did he invite you to dine  yes my dear father replied edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son	103.89767456054688
but manman whom god created in his own imageman upon whom god has laid his first his sole commandment to love his neighborman to whom god has given a voice to express his thoughtswhat is his first cry when he hears his fellowman is saved	167.68798828125
40064m    albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea	152.41696166992188
m de tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to him	58.37339401245117
she belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier	264.824462890625
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know	83.65814208984375
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau	123.060546875
all looked around athos himself stared	567.9017944335938
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert	79.65300750732422
on  they all set off swift as the wind	167.89234924316406
it is a prison within a prison the walls are double the thickness of the rest	110.78053283691406
this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice	55.94634246826172
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion	93.8472900390625
what do you say maximilian asked valentine	30.517566680908203
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin	152.19139099121094
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor	269.928955078125
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands  planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon	151.3347930908203
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne	402.18914794921875
mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond  so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all	156.46466064453125
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where theres a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table  in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place  oh	151.4860382080078
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	144.2921905517578
vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by teresa	166.2169952392578
there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal from harlequin even to pantaloon  chevalier	225.61669921875
30207m    good he said and m bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him	272.6219787597656
meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristos ear your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina  indeed said monte cristo	191.0707244873047
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth	356.18255615234375
tell me may i shake hands with you saying beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must i simply propose to you a choice of arms  albert said beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk  rather sir before we sit down i must demand your answer  albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer  i will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract  morcerf it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such a man as lieutenantgénéral the count of morcerf peer of france  what must then be done  40174m    what i have done albert	163.41453552246094
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark  which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling	406.5409851074219
he should have been  nothing said the king nothing	48.14977264404297
no replied dartagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people cannot see  whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion  chastised monsieur said dartagnan the expression is strong  it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face  ah  pardieu  i know full well that you dont turn your back to yours  and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly	193.72366333007812
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another	108.31470489501953
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m and madame danglars will think me a very illmannered person	72.42539978027344
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	141.65545654296875
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre  stay he said m	98.50515747070312
so you have seen the arm that was all	72.57293701171875
she revives cried the young man	41.252777099609375
the past  the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again	113.19275665283203
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and illbred  my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me  you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished	75.83098602294922
the first who advances is a dead man cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back	162.6708984375
open the door  the captain obeyed	133.13143920898438
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle andrea bit his lips	288.0384826660156
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater  can it be possible murmured villefort clasping his hands	183.6278533935547
oh maximilian maximilian you are certainly concealing something from us  pshaw said monte cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and joyful  maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count	136.5187530517578
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked  where is m de villefort  the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden	100.23478698730469

the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts	117.07318878173828

porthos was in bed and was playing a game at  lansquenet  with mousqueton to keep his hand in while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell	131.65240478515625

aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam	92.07649993896484
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masters guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill dartagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of dartagnan or rather of planchet after dartagnan had saved his life	131.9630126953125

andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand	113.68509674072266
very well come this way  dartagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through	271.4147644042969
the cabinet of m de tréville generally held so sacred became in an instant the annex of the antechamber	84.106201171875
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing	114.28792572021484
dartagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends	101.2862777709961
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man	24.167156219482422

he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly	243.30287170410156

this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore but the captain eager to escape from his false positionplaced between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birdswas in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a womans caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest	205.943603515625

the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse	128.57803344726562
they had only halberds before now they have muskets	260.4385681152344

yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village   armentières  read porthos armentières	161.66201782226562
for the last time will you come cried milady	44.196292877197266
he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside	152.0597381591797
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham	45.177528381347656
gentlemen said he if monsieur dartagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur dartagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal  you have my word monsieur and here is my sword  this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey  if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless you will not find her  what has become of her then asked rochefort eagerly	81.55786895751953
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop	313.7406311035156
yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency  i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly	167.88552856445312
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that	162.52320861816406
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him	106.3999252319336
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town	131.78831481933594
but dartagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that	84.45084381103516
the council of the musketeers  chapter xlviii	30.02036476135254
what are you doing asked milady with surprise	40.219661712646484
it was about eleven oclock at night	45.35135269165039
did you not yet know me	65.94300842285156
this is something new replied the king	56.530616760253906
however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work	168.94293212890625
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry	159.07518005371094
tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantès venture	319.91656494140625
thus for instance dont you in the first place want a horse  yes a horse  well then	118.7265625
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of others  and beppo led him outside the walls said the count	176.04869079589844
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory  when do you leave  immediately the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you	125.6383285522461
you must dress him up during my absence	166.04493713378906
there goes one cried athos at the end of five hundred paces	49.21121597290039
i think these fellows will never come  if you are in haste monsieur said dartagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you  there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to dartagnan	75.96572875976562
and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moments pause	102.49613952636719
dartagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired	212.76260375976562
do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost but on the contraryand it is i who say itsee enemies in all directions	92.68650817871094
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother	109.84010314941406
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time	125.37877655029297
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf  the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair	104.89380645751953
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him	58.91493606567383
to the seine with the officer were heard above all the noise deafening as it was	133.12159729003906
go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible  madame faltered dartagnan tis twenty years agoi have a good memorysince i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely hands  there is the other replied the queen and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me	140.98805236816406
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oclock	134.36595153808594
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches	86.10910034179688
at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man	116.67829132080078
ah my mother my poor mother said albert gazing through his tears at his mothers portrait if you know this how much must you suffer  come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend  but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal	153.59962463378906
besides which in a short time resumed dartagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety  well then i decide  i have your word then  yes tis given	216.93177795410156
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought dartagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence  there reigned a perfect stillness in the house	252.8839874267578
four hours later he was in neufchâtel	39.083221435546875
the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets	146.68325805664062
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching	194.75314331054688
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead  m	135.56968688964844
one day as i was setting off on an expedition go said she at your return i will give you a surprise i questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and i departed	107.06184387207031
the request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up	201.24758911132812
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	190.58370971679688
a loud cry could be heard by her	56.45742416381836
here father here he said take thistake it and send for something immediately and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six fivefranc pieces and some smaller coin	164.28097534179688
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene	167.12149047851562
then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that mazarin had poisoned him	107.35005950927734
alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it	75.84566497802734
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oclock	95.8174819946289
at madame de villeforts proposition he instantly winked his eyes	92.25580596923828
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus	132.53521728515625
the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed the abbé bowed	119.49957275390625
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	309.10284423828125
ah said morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despairah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them	168.55990600585938
save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands	67.66210174560547
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian come and help me he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the cloverfield a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions	173.9623260498047
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet	148.83291625976562
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison	185.3516387939453
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it	115.12455749511719
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even feel	111.57813262939453
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it	38.39020538330078
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent	84.61849212646484
oh the women the women cried the old soldier	69.73226928710938
on seeing him dartagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise	111.46007537841797
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo	138.13339233398438
my dear athos  you know that i am not alluding to you you are the pearl of brave bold men	61.262046813964844
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token	141.0221405029297
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house	51.273597717285156
with opium belladonna brucea snakewood and the cherrylaurel they put to sleep all who stand in their way	106.15096282958984
75  where is that  by the side of the luxembourg  and you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other  i believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty sire  but they have corresponded it is to him that the queen has been writing all the day	71.58181762695312
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis	98.42181396484375
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold	23.114192962646484
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinencewhile on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have donedartagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained for as to the letter addressed to m de tréville it had disappeared	118.11125183105469
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured dartagnan	77.84236145019531
by your poems  no i have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram i compose sermons my friend  what	402.3863220214844
what an awakening for the parisians said the queen radiant	136.1162567138672
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in	257.1495666503906
tell him all this for me for these are things which a king cannot say for himself  thanks sire thanks said the duke but your majesty may be assured that it is not thosei do not speak of monsieur de trévillewhom your majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you  ah	77.75099182128906
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors	171.6765594482422
is it then to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these 900000 francs demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of noirtier which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene	123.45091247558594
have you admired the rapidity of my fall	127.66444396972656
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven oclock we will then terminate this conversation	152.8540802001953
yes  shall i call him  yes  valentine went to the door and called barrois	70.72357940673828
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the duke	91.26829528808594
i also have made my preparations this morning  oh heavens	85.24849700927734
know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to account	208.30892944335938
its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet	151.16299438476562
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho	291.7660827636719
but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m davrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms	140.02120971679688
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhapsperhaps for even more than those	143.20521545410156
now if you marry m cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive	112.53467559814453
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew milady perfectly	124.22636413574219
staystayhow strange that it should not have occurred to me before	105.40481567382812
you are insane monsieur  monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting  and dartagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to dartagnan to serve him as a safeguard	101.63980102539062
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head  the devil	67.22565460205078
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eventpoor girl so young so rich so beautiful	281.4563903808594
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria	205.97975158691406
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning     he has given	189.1043701171875
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she  i am sure of it  nevertheless i confess i still doubt  but the  fleurdelis  on her shoulder  she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in consequence  athos she is your wife i tell you repeated dartagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other  yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually  it was dartagnan who now shook his head in his turn	104.31380462646484
adieu  and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he saidmonte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed	121.34288024902344
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all  ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear  you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough	115.0490951538086
from congo if you will  it must be farther off than even that  but what do i know of your parisian husbands  oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race  but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray	162.33135986328125
the count de guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by raoul who came to wish him goodday	43.20590591430664
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty	93.67475891113281
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well	175.11492919921875
how misfortune humbles a man  i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges	152.4275665283203
tell me what i must do this time are there any fresh instructions	122.18133544921875
the monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly  go on i know nothing as yet when you have finished your story god and i will judge  oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of naturethe whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the waveunited in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me place for the justice of god  delirium murmured the monk shaking his head	173.5626220703125
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit	135.572998046875
as nine oclock sounded dartagnan was at the place royale	74.03421020507812
thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes	230.1876220703125
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart	51.2713737487793
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love pains	314.1364440917969
im no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own	165.8228302001953
there was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the gate	66.84830474853516
though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh bicarat wished to hold out but jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to yield	155.90231323242188
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	143.68846130371094
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant	218.0258331298828
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do	156.97132873535156
as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him	97.32254028320312
good said monte cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a welldisciplined soldier  and you leave us said julie at a moments warning	113.04549407958984
well be it so said she	80.31395721435547
this was a question the young man asked himself whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover	298.1432800292969
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act	178.06112670898438
ma foi  i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i will reform  and morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to m danglars said  baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf  but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said  monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer  to reflect said morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us  count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them  i do not understand you baron said morcerf	134.2948455810547
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo	360.3460998535156
then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons	260.0108337402344
spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste	190.67616271972656
to do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their word	137.73724365234375
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti  a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room	84.15770721435547
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the hotel	166.4525604248047
patience cried athos one of our party is still wanting  the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be	195.44435119628906
i shall be about again in a few days  why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris	83.06063842773438
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will see  you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly	277.0012512207031
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saintméran arose from her pillow	92.7624740600586
mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement	145.9054412841797
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure	226.04335021972656

nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum  ah	454.55462646484375
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you  you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude  as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window	74.4361572265625
coquenard gently advised him to be patient	174.499267578125

you are acquainted with the young viscount are you  we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome  true true cried danglars	106.00401306152344
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched	253.9801788330078
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days	110.33358764648438
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write	107.5956802368164
at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs	76.18962097167969
ah said he you have remarked  i must have been blind not to have seen  yes said porthos that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church buried in this vile quarter solely for the sake of seeing me  monsieur porthos said the procurators wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes	87.73783874511719

but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor	118.87045288085938
is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist	131.8349609375
this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs	245.62831115722656
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentlemans side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts	94.31465148925781
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market  monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti	129.048095703125
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid	145.4484405517578
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then  my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said dartagnan	194.05279541015625
dartagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	116.72825622558594
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief	279.41339111328125
it seems that he is a spaniard	37.82794952392578
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was	60.961429595947266
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage we are supposed not to know each other  you are right	89.82559967041016
who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol	73.54173278808594
i am going to fire  gentlemen exclaimed dartagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are about	250.23281860351562
the violins began to sound with all their might but nobody listened to them	161.4135284423828
i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is  planchet hesitated	78.6156005859375
dame nanette look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread  oh thank you sir thank you monsieur broussel said friquet i am so fond of apricots  broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine oclock	135.49530029296875
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receivergeneral	118.85151672363281
have you answered the question i put to you on entering the roomwhere do you keep the poison you generally use madame  madame de villefort raised her arms to heaven and convulsively struck one hand against the other	104.1746826171875
do you agree with aramis  not at all said dartagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion  what	92.09265899658203
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold	97.66716003417969
dartagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	114.34434509277344

everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils	203.411376953125
but the real adieux were made in mme	117.41987609863281
it is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men	200.90240478515625
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips	88.99177551269531
dartagnan himself was moved by them	135.09506225585938
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her	78.28771209716797
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her	112.03801727294922
you wish to ask for liberty andi give it you  oh my lord answered dartagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of you  you have your liberty repeated mazarin in terror	99.11775970458984

in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end	155.0450897216797
if perchance m de morcerf came he would find m cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of eugénie has never been admitted  you may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him  but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased  he	144.73341369628906
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	70.65680694580078
he is not curious thought dartagnan	75.18892669677734
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall thinkfor how do i know to the contrarythat this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it  i will come counti will be sure to come said villefort eagerly	88.88583374023438
pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you  you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder	64.47084045410156
during the darkness as before my supper was brought	167.79942321777344
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos  yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	61.10272216796875
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble	110.9918212890625
but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them	188.59677124023438
one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp	110.67266082763672
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him	109.76612091064453
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was	30.364517211914062
oh yes replied the count understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man	96.2303466796875
the guests  in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion	55.17289352416992
three months afterwards a woman travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her son carried me away	164.149658203125
in the meantime follow me  the cardinal alighted the three musketeers did likewise	119.61991882324219
you have a sad air  alas said dartagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate  tell me  presently said dartagnan	70.23262023925781
your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired	309.5308837890625
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired	77.8616714477539
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussels release	89.36488342285156
avenge me of that infamous de wardes said milady between her teeth and i shall soon know how to get rid of youyou double idiot you animated sword blade  fall voluntarily into my arms hypocritical and dangerous woman said dartagnan likewise to himself after having abused me with such effrontery and afterward i will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill  dartagnan lifted up his head	178.91351318359375
he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk	130.86289978027344
monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced	73.67303466796875
have you not mentioned that name to me  as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright	69.25797271728516
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	75.40744018554688
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian	57.655067443847656
now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion m de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly	190.8155975341797
the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage	187.7142791748047
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything degenerates  i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis	230.43341064453125
then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga	145.88026428222656
is there a house in the neighborhood asked dartagnan	36.6444206237793
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that dartagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood	87.66553497314453
you accuse me of fear i have not so much as you have since i do not fly as you do	45.3822135925293
yes it is very annoying said vampa but we have not seen him  then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared	94.95358276367188
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him	58.03861618041992
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones	129.47023010253906
i have not tried to discover her other name  kitty cried milady	101.05885314941406
you have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you	76.47979736328125
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual	221.64390563964844
dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	46.48849105834961
we have had great annoyances there	141.8291473388672
theres one just arrived and she handed the letter to dartagnan	124.1021499633789
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price  his excellency is not perhaps aware that m danglars gave 16000 francs for his horses  very well	94.1476821899414
bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world	48.85847854614258
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel	39.10287094116211
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of falsehood  with the queen sir replied athos in his calm vibrating voice	95.82872009277344
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter	62.96896743774414
it was in fact mordaunt whom dartagnan had followed without knowing it	118.6359634399414
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy  sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate	104.48794555664062
will you not come with me he said i shall pass by blois  raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go	65.44880676269531
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of youa remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn	79.64985656738281
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them  reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe  buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	94.4472885131836
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince	38.39577865600586
the same evening the following was read in  le messager   by telegraph	268.5452575683594
monte cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawingroom	49.1461181640625
his family will care much about such a trifle as that	205.17945861816406
then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner	95.80464172363281
when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost	168.019287109375
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless	155.5227508544922
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door	119.90242767333984
the abbé told me it was worth 50000 francs muttered caderousse	76.15028381347656
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of m de tréville	116.98334503173828
you are only betrayed  the king sighed deeply	114.24395751953125
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows  my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return	120.62884521484375
ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court	125.11927795410156
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partners murmurs and lamentations	232.72372436523438
what then is to become of royalty  the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question	241.30624389648438
sblood cried he to dartagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you	94.30223846435547

but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage  i do not think that is the case  however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed	52.61158752441406
do you know that monsieur  the king commands it madame excuse me  i will not suffer it	78.38438415527344
i defy you to find him who executed it  silence said a hollow voice	159.49322509765625

she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order	100.00486755371094
the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out  by the telegraph sire louis xviii	174.30450439453125
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours	182.96385192871094
the first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion	216.38174438476562
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy	173.42330932617188
now he said are you in pain  yes my head is not only swimming but burning  whats the matter with this head said dartagnan raising the battered hat	199.2429962158203
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes	161.95335388183594
athos never received any letters athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know	195.6171112060547
ah said the count watching andreas countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca	154.7626190185547
all hands to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in	170.6734161376953
tis true that mercédès is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be  a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth	152.4799041748047
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said patrick	200.2131805419922
he aspires to the hand of the proud eugénie  what does that signify so long as they favor your suit  but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary	103.86507415771484
at the same hour as on the preceding evening dartagnan retired	50.200927734375
not here he said doubtless she is in her bedroom he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering	180.77476501464844
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him	69.81918334960938
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching miladys bed offered her services	104.3366928100586
i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme	369.0146179199219
have you been or are you his mistress  oh no cried milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth	132.4559326171875
in the regiment said dartagnan he is called porthos the queen started but his true name is the chevalier du vallon  de bracieux de pierrefonds added porthos	123.88847351074219
are you satisfied gentlemen asked mazarin	70.40067291259766
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them	64.46094512939453
see what is going on monsieur dartagnan said he	34.754634857177734
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours	118.5255355834961
i will take him dead thats all  a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	149.14984130859375
to youthe only just good and compassionate being i have met with	286.09539794921875
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where dartagnan was confined	146.04550170898438
you have decidedly some genius at your control   ma foi  spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvetlined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies  as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf	97.57061767578125
can he have and she stopped	304.3746643066406
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss	229.53558349609375
milady does not know me i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her  well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos  for shame said aramis	115.76001739501953
cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m morrels apartment	77.65081024169922
so dartagnan began  sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france  mordaunt did not reply	198.8285369873047
people die very suddenly in your house m de villefort  what cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea  still sir and i shall always do so replied davrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m de villefort  the magistrate trembled convulsively	99.50665283203125
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	120.86836242675781
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis  add monsieur dartagnan my lord	138.44277954101562
he turned round it was danglars	49.200889587402344
oh indeed i cannot permit you to go  is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear  ill tell you answered the countess	122.48338317871094
i dont see what is to keep me here  a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis	102.68148803710938
he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure	95.4503402709961
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow  as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains	141.79446411132812
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her	126.99899291992188
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	100.4740982055664
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea	157.17002868652344
excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind  you do not wish me to marry m franz dépinay observed valentine	81.48377990722656
take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom	102.64614868164062
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river  thats well said dartagnan	55.3128547668457
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter  madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm	171.8425750732422

when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her selfpossession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now	172.06773376464844

how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch	187.84544372558594
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris  it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters	114.93805694580078
dartagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction  stay you where you are and dont you stir or i will pull this ear off	188.5955810546875
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv	81.82096099853516
goodevening valentine said a wellknown voice	59.880531311035156
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride	151.26278686523438
now this is not all he said you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs  i shall still have my place  no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents message  oh sir what are you proposing  a jest  sir unless you force me  i think i can effectually force you and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket	90.55764770507812
danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow	93.5811767578125
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one	202.85316467285156
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saintméran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	43.829288482666016
goodevening m beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated  beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied m de morcerf as you saw  and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together	100.23310852050781
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity	167.2634735107422
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late	130.52713012695312
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	142.92080688476562
light me i am going to the queen  bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way	76.97928619384766
at last he heard the voice of la ramee	25.46290397644043
yellow boys said caderousse no i thank you  oh you despise them  on the contrary i esteem them but will not have them  you can change them idiot gold is worth five sous  exactly and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold	252.82720947265625
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis	52.699607849121094
oh if you refuse my advice  what do you advise said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing	61.89894104003906
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description	72.27659606933594
dartagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of mme	55.22432327270508
pardieu  said he here is a strange thing	40.873207092285156
could the prisoners see each other he asked	146.21572875976562
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five oclock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the  coupé  of the diligence which closed upon her	79.360595703125
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also	161.7037353515625
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	79.95062255859375
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	180.66290283203125
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	50.02803421020508
now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the carriage  this did not take long	162.26162719726562
dartagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men	137.0778350830078
on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the parisian troops ran to him	127.97333526611328
i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressingroom	72.10881805419922
you are the child of my captivity	34.50161361694336
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing	54.41277313232422
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud	217.9542999267578
oh leave me sir you are tempting meyou make me doubt the goodness of providenceit is impossible it cannot be  are you the first that this hand has stricken	112.38935089111328
as you see my health is but indifferent	96.85587310791016
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary	151.30491638183594
our family although still rich for my fathers income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence	134.3431396484375
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa	156.05136108398438
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall	40.027923583984375
monsieur dartagnan he cried vade retro satanas  so my dear bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend  sir replied bazin the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so  i dont understand you bazin nor can i see how i can be a stumblingblock in the way of your salvation said dartagnan	111.88137817382812
as soon as his engagement with the patron of  la jeune amélie  ended he would hire a small vessel on his own accountfor in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastresand under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo	63.01179885864258
madame he replied monsieur dartagnans prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment	121.18998718261719
yes my poor girl replied morrel i come to bring and to hear bad tidings  this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full  dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you what i am about to say is very serious	131.48388671875
the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristos table and that of signor pastrini	60.32713317871094
and will you direct us exclaimed the young man	42.377803802490234
lord de winter perceived nothing of this	45.673789978027344
he insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti or monsieur de beaufort or monsieur de bouillon or monsieur delbeuf or the coadjutor or madame de longueville or broussel or the parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance	81.08800506591797
tis more than possible answered the comte de la fere	54.8382453918457
at what time you please sir replied franz	33.93256759643555
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo  oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs  and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land  nothing at all smugglers are not thieves  but these two corsican bandits said franz calculating the chances of peril	109.09278869628906
what is it said she starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock	100.34922790527344
and the other  which  the short one  oh he was not a gentleman ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration  some lackey murmured dartagnan	162.34365844726562
you will kill yourself cried planchet	46.15435791015625
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance	335.9654846191406
with a word dartagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palaiscardinal	123.08401489257812
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you	74.78716278076172
he is gone to noisy  how dost thou know  ah faith	236.9251708984375
let them hold themselves in readiness to march tonight	192.7091064453125
tis a matter of conscience with them as with us  meantime here we are enemies said porthos	163.0120086669922
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	101.09668731689453
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head	70.0655746459961
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition	78.60232543945312
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe	97.81117248535156
apropos when do you aspect m dépinay  five or six days hence at the latest  and when is he to be married  immediately on the arrival of m and madame de saintméran  bring him to see me	77.40168762207031
have we ceased to be men  no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew  de winter only replied by a groan	147.64540100097656
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth  do you propose to me to do so dartagnan  decidedly and honestly  on whose side asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon	103.3570327758789
it is you bernouin she said	37.53271484375
bonacieux and was expressed in these terms  there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you	136.3847198486328
as we pass from one room to another i will open the windows to let you breathe  monte cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground floor	79.87421417236328
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	176.32635498046875
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here	78.52845001220703
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink  valentine shuddered	248.70069885253906
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting	103.51570129394531
what do you say said louise	30.45371437072754
75  does your eminence command that they both be instantly arrested  it will be too late they will be gone  but still we can make sure that they are so  take ten men of my guardsmen and search the two houses thoroughly  instantly monseigneur and rochefort went hastily out of the apartment	197.53125
and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons  were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this edmond dantès  this dangerous mans name was  edmond dantès	123.74724578857422
then that person is a most amiable person  albert looked around and perceived franz	203.66983032226562
he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done	81.99698638916016
see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them	140.67001342773438
disarm him onlymake sure of his sword	268.0557861328125
he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust	373.6413879394531
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time	87.16085052490234
comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story	87.10841369628906
yes count you know what i told you  all remains the same then in that quarter  it is more than ever a settled thing said lucienand considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures	102.37861633300781
i answer for all that the prince said	82.96543884277344
may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it  it has been in the family a very long while returned monte cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital	163.5597686767578
are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue saint denis and the rue saint antoine  and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good guitant  my lord said comminges i answered that to compose a ligue only one ingredient was wantingin my opinion an essential onea duc de guise moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice  no but they mean to make a fronde as they call it said guitant	191.48434448242188
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach	200.6161651611328
dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	126.8628158569336
i have told him the truth that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses	50.92872619628906
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place  rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can	150.34249877929688
there was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria	133.0489959716797
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound	122.04827117919922
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky	79.847412109375
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one conditionthat he sometimes remembers the kings faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name	202.02926635742188
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so	69.71807098388672
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it	108.80513763427734
dartagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of evil	200.96151733398438
and yet you say he has sent you some as from us  here is his letter said dartagnan and he presented the note to his comrades	73.97517395019531
but since our resolution is formed let us act promptly	285.80169677734375
i shall hear this morning that m danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wifes this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france	74.58068084716797
a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the sea	98.46453094482422
i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust	139.75965881347656
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending	190.80259704589844
edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly	347.8297424316406
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz	141.16969299316406
at least dartagnan said to himself as he took the road to villarscotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking	44.31981658935547
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	281.9615783691406
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else  you have talked of me  yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle  then i am also a puzzle to your mother	97.74897003173828
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression	66.05712127685547
this was to go himself to m de la trémouille	27.575544357299805
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover	144.65489196777344
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris  how does that annoy you  it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose  so said andrea you are speculating upon me  what fine words he uses  i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken  well well dont be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous	109.39485931396484
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken  shall i send word to him as coming from you  yes certainly  shall i tell him that he can count on you  to the end  and you will leave the command to him  of the war yes but in politics  you must know it is not his element  he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own fashion  you care about it then so much  since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red  one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing	124.9403076171875
that was dartagnans road as he was going to the louvre	49.985374450683594
and now my dear child adieu for the present	61.80597686767578
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé	53.83723068237305
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majestys  well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	101.36734771728516
thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want now it is for me to perform my promise	85.81352233886719
why said aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were shot  well i said dartagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot	192.31117248535156
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself	254.55657958984375
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his lips	184.98565673828125
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt	223.24960327148438
0159m    owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès	136.8469696044922
everything is best in its time monseigneur	351.5417785644531
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme	71.88658905029297
it is for me to give orders here and not you  monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you  i want none it was a temporary indisposition	87.57537078857422
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone is he not albert  yes and a sincere friend i love him devotedly	112.7465591430664
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming	279.5421142578125
we started a stag of ten branches	319.5585632324219
dartagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning	123.9149398803711
it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening	157.5850830078125
we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere	107.88652038574219
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce youwith your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received	117.50321960449219
at the sight of his friend porthos uttered a loud cry of joy and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection	59.65401840209961
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	142.71194458007812
the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws and thus i was right when i said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sirthat relatively to what i have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn  but with what motive have you learned all this inquired villefort in astonishment	115.43172454833984
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection	125.74597930908203
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you mine  with a heavy heart dartagnan again bent his way toward the ferry	117.12773895263672
as he passed them he said  they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner  indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price  does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders	134.94479370117188
dartagnan examined her with a rapid glance	45.747520446777344
i shall be gone only a few moments  villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace	156.0626678466797
it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you	73.77706146240234
and being a musketeer but for a time i only fight when i am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by you  by  us  you mean cried dartagnan	90.88473510742188
i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to breakfast	61.45230484008789
there what do you think now of the affair	38.850013732910156
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her	78.41541290283203

he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	57.87327194213867
you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive round the walls and reenter by the porta san giovanni  these are my words exactly  well this route is impossible  impossible  very dangerous to say the least  dangerousand why  on account of the famous luigi vampa  pray who may this famous luigi vampa be inquired albert he may be very famous at rome but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris  what	124.49214172363281
our blow has failed for tonight let us withdraw	283.9416809082031
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend dartagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal  what	195.88546752929688
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go  i shall never swim again replied faria	123.30842590332031
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows	83.31529998779297
he had a heavy handdear old athosafter drinking  dartagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman	151.64779663085938
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting  these words redoubled the eagerness of dartagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace	208.44056701660156
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts	69.11591339111328
you live on your estate happy in golden mediocrity	254.0735626220703
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there	87.32868194580078
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power	206.58084106445312
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars	136.07286071777344
i will tell you all replied anne	36.41918182373047
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him	60.18809509277344
you have restored my courage by a single word go i will rejoin you  milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found rocheforts lackey and gave him his instructions	140.63058471679688
miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a second	132.33932495117188
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arrive	236.46908569335938
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in action  and i said the marshal what am i to do  wait here to receive the troops	81.10649108886719
25 the other in the rue de la harpe no	36.28522491455078
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	49.46418762207031
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted but as she was only a procurators wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you dont offer me any holy water  porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years	158.57102966308594
information about the mission of project gutenberg   project gutenberg is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middleaged and new computers	32.64813995361328
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her	84.50836944580078
the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone	171.03286743164062
madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep	54.565147399902344
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him	111.11425018310547
he fixed his eyes upon dartagnan even more earnestly than before	104.83209228515625
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber  the two travelers consulted for a moment	113.87976837158203
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactorthen count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols	159.55642700195312
write to me at paris to m joannes in the palais royal arcade pierre no	127.63766479492188
all four were to meet the next day at eleven oclock	44.27978515625
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	36.12429428100586
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day	53.28190994262695
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man	135.1676788330078
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost	82.5776596069336
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé  count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me  alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature  monsieur cried the duchess seizing athoss hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you  athos laughed	164.7176513671875
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father  it is well returned the voice tomorrow  these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall	127.4099349975586
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance dartagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london	85.74464416503906
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace	181.44793701171875
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the summit	135.6554412841797
he did not wear the uniform cloakwhich was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independencebut a ceruleanblue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun	123.94649505615234
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpentlike embraces	259.4824523925781
had not government better profit by it	458.35723876953125
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin  perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myself  to them or to us do you mean aramis  to no one	151.82070922851562
what oclock is it  the baron drew out his watch	62.12567901611328
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money  no to the cardinal  its the same thing cried the young woman	142.43309020996094
halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers	105.32136535644531
he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased	225.2953643798828
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father	149.33908081054688
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor  0325m    i did  and you followed the business of a tailor  true i was a tailor till the trade fell off	131.87644958496094
think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us  along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves  the three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace	207.84170532226562
my dear athos     i wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest     for a fortnight	110.78153228759766
m franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us	136.20469665527344
no i would rather die  by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated illfortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed  folly folly follyto carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at	219.05686950683594
porthos and aramis did the same	54.19583511352539
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock	84.56625366210938
the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace	183.2793426513672
to london cried porthos and what the devil are we going to do in london  that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to me  but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none  nor i said aramis	68.84855651855469
the counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man	98.39501953125
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself	96.35514831542969
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows  gentlemen	313.0054626464844
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much  planchet shook his head and said nothing	98.8946533203125
the lackeys followed armed to the teeth	168.80194091796875
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved	185.09286499023438
what men call the chances of fatenamely ruin change circumstancesi have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me	250.63453674316406
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it  but dartagnan was still in a desponding mood	99.39776611328125
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo	139.6241912841797
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris	110.58488464355469
rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best  ah m morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owners hand m	98.90804290771484
the robust scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover him	124.79680633544922
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive	133.39712524414062
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court	96.36122131347656
a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there	282.94573974609375
has she left armentières  grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	81.50826263427734
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all  he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	121.87921905517578
planchet sir  lieutenant yesterday said aramis captain today colonel doubtless tomorrow in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of france  question him about the fight said athos	335.1435546875
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a restingplace in his heart	221.91061401367188
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart	143.70765686035156
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man	71.33185577392578
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen  private interests are as nothing before the interests of all	132.7610321044922
youve killed him i think  no wounded his horse only  what would you have my dear fellow	191.15318298339844
i am doing what is right  the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with dartagnan	90.35337829589844
no sir before all who are here  alberts witnesses looked at each other	205.88519287109375
nightwhy for heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark  indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions	183.6789093017578
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant	153.8126220703125
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which mordaunt had given in french	131.61203002929688
as to dartagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards	92.0537109375
la ramee stretched out his legs grimaud took a tablecloth tore it into strips and tied la ramees feet together	183.8690643310547
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	86.10679626464844
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love  well but said aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent	76.75606536865234
the young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed aloud	34.85383605957031
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to dartagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served	102.29185485839844
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured	73.26036071777344
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished	161.8295440673828
do you see whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt	96.32418060302734
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters	80.75719451904297
there said dartagnan what did i tell you	31.91130256652832
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission  the young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself	126.2608871459961
dartagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when m de tréville entered	61.746707916259766
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise	91.30777740478516
why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way thats all	138.33053588867188
the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees	79.85924530029297
at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old wormeaten table was a tall young man of twenty or twoandtwenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled	80.95227813720703
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks were	222.93258666992188
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me  then today madame  oh today i am no further than gratitude  ah	187.81321716308594
there he is  somebody has disturbed him without doubt said dartagnan	184.6907501220703
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands	47.974830627441406
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti	100.86715698242188
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	59.485206604003906
but for the sake of the mother said the count	23.163028717041016
the count continued  i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years  the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety	79.29811096191406
you refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment	42.91658401489258
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks	149.5603485107422
the king savedwe shall assemble our friends togetherwe will head the puritansreconquer england we shall reenter londonplace him securely on his throne  and he will make us dukes and peers said porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect	193.02593994140625

project gutenberg is a registered trademark	27.602256774902344
and youwhat are you doing here replied dartagnan	35.94867706298828
father and son  m noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	129.21255493164062
yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again  30309m    never  never  i never returned to the country where she lived  to malta  yes malta  she is then now at malta  i think so  and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer  heryes  but only her do you then still hate those who separated you  i hate them	172.4869384765625
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franzs curiosity	366.4344482421875
i will call thee mouston and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer  oh cried mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor i shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask  alas thought dartagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me  will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance	112.05158996582031
does madame de morcerf dance  never you can talk to her she so delights in your conversation  indeed  30283m    yes truly and i assure you	178.60690307617188
count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof  i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another  but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not  the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	170.56512451171875
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	187.83067321777344
buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy	123.39888763427734
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself  monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms	97.14839172363281
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiersall proved the great richelieu no longer in existence	283.97540283203125
danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows	72.72834777832031
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle darmillys fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantios malediction on desdemona	122.19624328613281
but this is not to the purposeour business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace  all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium	101.32960510253906
i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard	49.532752990722656
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes  they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment	215.12271118164062
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed	113.38776397705078

the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive  but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded	241.62046813964844
maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot	129.92037963867188

andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventyfive thousand livres per annum	106.0050277709961
then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	61.9228515625
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson  french of rome  i am glad to hear it baronfor i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants	61.60113525390625
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at dartagnan	72.60824584960938
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air	62.16817092895508
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely	151.3729705810547
your voice is that of a young man  i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here	51.674964904785156

it seems a likely story to me  and to me too  besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain	121.36637115478516
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage	167.33982849121094
i was there too and i never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription	86.55125427246094

as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward milady who standing on the deck followed him with her eyes	64.4648208618164
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering  villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back	141.060546875
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours  which you please monsieur said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven  thirtyfive minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you  and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	135.9712677001953

several times lord de winter porthos or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response	132.73773193359375
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine	124.46080017089844
had dartagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character	104.92000579833984

it was then three oclock in the morning	19.530492782592773
m de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him	60.899574279785156
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his buttonhole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush	118.17603302001953
the host stood at the door	32.051143646240234
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea you love me  yes i do or may the devil take me	159.40464782714844
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	85.84961700439453
but dartagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m bazin and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friends valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five	120.7635726928711
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep tonight  madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction	144.47271728515625
in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage	106.93959045410156
saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor  morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude	96.552001953125
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or lost  ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all  i can understand that said dartagnan	169.38076782226562
bonacieux dartagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left halffainting upon an armchair	98.705078125
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking	120.93172454833984
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saintmérans	86.0734634399414
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do they opened the door and the four men alighted  franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fathers death which had hitherto been a mystery	128.31503295898438
come in exclaimed dartagnan and another servant entered	146.70004272460938
eight oclock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep	319.959716796875
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way  ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldnt surprise me at all  perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us  nonsense	109.46697998046875
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin	128.69168090820312
albert attributed to franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask	223.95040893554688
they are mistaken bring him here at eight oclock sir and may heaven bless you as i bless you  and now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us  better my lord  diable	137.0869903564453
resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day dartagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast	120.66934967041016
my dear raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked	114.00250244140625
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted	95.97738647460938
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto	187.07733154296875
let me see continued the stranger i am one of your largest creditors  your bills at least are the first that will fall due  do you wish for time to pay  a delay would save my honor and consequently my life  how long a delay do you wish for  morrel reflected	130.35577392578125
adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping edmonds hand convulsivelyadieu  oh nono not yet he cried do not forsake me	176.39346313476562
you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free         distribution of project gutenberg works	29.672754287719727
are they paid  yes tonight  let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough i have nothing more to do with them nor they with me	189.841796875
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years	57.89750671386719
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us  but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison  in prison said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison  ever since there were prisoners in it answered comminges	215.1055908203125
the moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that charles i had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement	121.3107681274414
no but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted	160.98753356933594
do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abbé	65.07940673828125
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate	157.1140594482422
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness  what do you say edmond  i say since you command me mercédès i must die  die	127.0005111694336
goodevening m de morcerf  the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality	91.49994659423828
upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was porthos and not dartagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and disappeared  so it was with monsieur dartagnan this stranger meant to quarrel  it appears so  and do you know what has become of him  no i never saw him until that moment and have not seen him since  very well i know all that i wish to know	96.88710021972656
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long  so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice	128.791748046875
one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree	108.65110778808594
what do you want monsieur demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to dartagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures	62.676292419433594
i like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly	324.4646301269531
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter	169.6860809326172
he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for counsel	81.61124420166016
as he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts bedroom	80.3239974975586
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	144.7354278564453
does he hate his majesty as much as he does us  pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property  true said aramis but silence	169.1396942138672
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes	137.89817810058594
ah said i after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once is that the example you set penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols	180.0187225341797

he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly	72.4418716430664
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence	327.0367431640625
oh no said he but help me to die if you can  are you a priest asked raoul	63.702205657958984
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad  but if he does not come said dartagnan	56.70999526977539
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	282.8769226074219
he would no longer be alone	40.69878387451172

one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared	85.25154113769531
this was the more so because bonacieuxs reflections were all rosecolored	207.1200714111328

i know it will serve me as it did when we came over  and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer	135.84982299804688

and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de châteaurenaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf	64.3555679321289

the blood had mounted to the head of dartagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis	66.81675720214844
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos	171.90084838867188
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads	64.38159942626953

ah monseigneur continued bonacieux throwing himself at his eminences feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world reveres  the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man  the cardinal has touched me with his hand	131.5706787109375
i might as well say count benedetto	290.8932800292969
embrace porthos from aramis and myself	180.8115692138672

dartagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water	147.55194091796875
but enough of thishere is my card take it to your master  madame will await my return  yes go  the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street	143.963623046875

truly this is an indignity  be kind enough to pardon me madame but in this circumstance i am but the instrument which the king employs	124.0418701171875
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set	131.0498046875
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point	78.97738647460938
bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you	84.36221313476562
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation	170.7020721435547
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where davrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief	45.32651138305664

scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun	184.202880859375
he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil	149.2152099609375
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something  i was trying said porthos to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed  and you couldnt remember  no  well search my friend search and when you have found you will tell me will you not  pardieu said porthos	113.48843383789062
by mordaunt  yes but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt  that is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us	172.94996643066406
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé	90.29187774658203
milady smiled and dartagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile	85.8307113647461
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses	61.724246978759766
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort  yes but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent  when he is absent i am there  but when you leave him for instance  oh	59.359771728515625
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear	102.59721374511719
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy	95.8025894165039
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate	95.6287841796875
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition  and villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant whom his son had not called	106.06368255615234
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly	84.8169937133789
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing  ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung  partant pour la syrie we will not go alone to the garden  then said mercédès i will lead the way  turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm  the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercédès	161.0081024169922
might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him	79.51002502441406
look said dartagnan day is declining	245.49282836914062
he didnt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous thing  mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place	160.26710510253906
all the crowd gave way before morrel	209.42648315429688
can i trust in you  oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul i am ready to die for your majesty  this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking it	67.39246368408203
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	41.899505615234375
dartagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their lodging	79.31549835205078
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating  the notary the notary  m de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother	83.71013641357422
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow	141.47630310058594
but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles  the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded	121.38784790039062
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman  ah	186.46104431152344
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow	98.34989929199219
let us take our precautions athos  but suppose they come unarmed	147.23257446289062
and what will that signify to me	39.29970169067383
the servant entered just as he had finished	81.82532501220703
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge	272.91046142578125
the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of it	113.88568878173828
the people have seen monsieur de condé a prince of the blood royal arrested by my motherinlaw maria de medicis they saw my motherinlaw their former regent expelled by the cardinal they saw monsieur de vendome that is to say the son of henry iv a prisoner at vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a brousselgood god	125.55496215820312
when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race  i am highly flattered returned beauchamp	91.11631774902344
but now you are happy  doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain  and your present happiness has it softened your heart  my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	164.52557373046875
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it	87.90644073486328
is our little neighbor worse asked dartagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth	80.66755676269531
speak quickly friend  the man said in a low voice i wishi wish you to spare me the walk back to paris	119.20455169677734
if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great	950.1041870117188
this key was furnished with a small iron pointa negligence on the part of the locksmith	70.20771026611328
stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms	128.08706665039062
the next day was spent as usual	52.06584930419922
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but dartagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kittys apartment	131.9236297607422
over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persias sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor	132.99192810058594
it is no affair of mine  i know not why you meddle said fernand seizing his arm but this i know you have some motive of personal hatred against dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others  i	116.70359802246094
and now let everyone retire  must i go too asked valentine timidly	427.3174133300781
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	99.32830810546875
june and july were the terrible months with athos	489.3628845214844
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window one doesnt descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a limetree and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac  aramis burst into a fit of laughter	129.61297607421875
the baron dépinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged  do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him	84.09617614746094
the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other employment	127.4031982421875
do you hear anything said she	34.35269546508789
monte cristo on the contrary took the right hand arrived near a clump of trees he stopped	87.93888854980469
will you let me be killed	76.22711944580078
should he find him at all	108.89202117919922
i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety	116.75747680664062
50239m    ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed	69.21697235107422
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed	129.0916748046875
and who was he  twas that low fellow bonacieux  and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street	174.94174194335938
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph	104.10882568359375
porthos murmured the comte de la fere	16.034950256347656
you are in a hurry captain  danglars said edmond smiling i will say to you as mercédès said just now to caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong to me that may bring me bad luck  your pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the  pharaon  cannot be under weigh again in less than three months  we are always in a hurry to be happy m danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune	82.76325225830078
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword  marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration	86.50821685791016
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered	155.41319274902344
after a moments interval cocles appeared	102.3261947631836
it was the king speaking on the scaffold	45.22974395751953
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead	226.9410400390625
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newtons system	128.0636749267578
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done	224.4343719482422
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous operabox more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat pocket	201.2010498046875
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady	113.6991958618164
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have  he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul	125.43391418457031
and how many men had he with him  i do not know sire answered the minister of police	54.426124572753906
no one answered to his first knocking	119.57572937011719
now what is it they want to know	43.92100524902344
it is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged him	28.9721622467041
put him to death  franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	92.51858520507812
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth  these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused	246.93125915527344
yes replied the young woman and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one  i will undertake to divert him replied the count	103.49931335449219
you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me	26.889873504638672
the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit down	208.77749633789062
porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos	172.1754913330078
remain here fasten the door inside and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this and he tapped thricetwo taps close together and pretty hard the other after an interval and lighter	367.29266357421875
she is allpowerful yonder she will help me	99.73975372314453
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done  mordaunt bowed humbly	117.31057739257812
possessed by one single thoughtthat of the promise he had made and of the responsibility he had takenhe retired last to his chamber begged the host to procure him a map of the province bent over it examined every line traced upon it perceived that there were four different roads from béthune to armentières and summoned the lackeys	192.491455078125
perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember  what do you mean my lord  i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience i have but you in the world haydée through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice  do you hear him valentine exclaimed haydée he says that through me he will sufferthrough  me  who would yield my life for his  the count withdrew for a moment	112.7637710571289
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence	93.58926391601562
i see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer	64.59130859375
by my honor these gascons are incorrigible	226.60020446777344
oh my god cried she my god	41.15256881713867
god has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	112.16165924072266
i make the first advances said the king	35.60708236694336
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed  caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès	112.79764556884766
it is for you replied a gendarme	40.054405212402344
if you want anything you can ring  oh my god my god	65.42733764648438
will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp	135.73281860351562
the inquiry  m de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil	50.66133499145508
things passed as on the night before	200.89837646484375
besides germain was in the interests of the queen and if anything should happen mme	153.24700927734375
exactly  he lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story  40132m    andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hares paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable illtemper	122.34754180908203
debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with gold	103.1025390625
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promisenot to reward you i believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one	154.0543975830078
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief	217.01112365722656
luigi vampas bill of fare  we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by danglars	418.5646667480469
she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master	108.48332214355469
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again	134.867919921875
the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saintdenis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station	172.3663330078125
the same order was followed in returning nor did grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai	197.07542419433594
come speak avow freely that you accuse him  no sire but i say that he deceives himself	148.83872985839844
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows	198.532958984375
these gentlemen are with me said winter	70.61268615722656
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying  alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely	163.42567443847656
i will bless youi  i am dying cried mordaunt come to me	80.37257385253906
if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand	141.47447204589844
grimaud made a sign that he was going away	29.739774703979492
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness	122.89834594726562
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so dartagnan declares  just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door	389.2877502441406
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall	121.10674285888672
that instant the arm of porthos fell	132.03526306152344
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the ministertoward the subordinate and the master	101.26362609863281
under the other cardinal continued dartagnan we didnt know enough to make our profits this however doesnt concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me  porthos sighed	179.75050354003906
now i dont set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies	322.79473876953125
you have heard what i said	49.219791412353516
now i think no more i say only that fortune has turned against mei had thought to gain heaven and now i have lost it	142.39559936523438
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie  at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared	103.95049285888672
hardly had dartagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication	133.94369506835938
what are you going to tell me  are we quite alone my friend  yes quite but why all these precautions  because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	69.03422546386719
you are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with energy  such was cardinal richelieus opinion my lord  the cardinal interrupted mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me	304.3092041015625
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after fiveandtwenty years of exile	159.41171264648438
ah said dartagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold	84.01112365722656
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give	81.0992202758789
you follow the world my young friend and i tremble lest grace prove not efficacious  be satisfied my reverend father i can answer for myself  mundane presumption  i know myself father my resolution is irrevocable  then you persist in continuing that thesis  i feel myself called upon to treat that and no other	363.76300048828125
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne  the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold	59.0415153503418
the chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any	443.1702880859375
one is that of edmond dantès lost to me long long since	193.25469970703125
on the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous cry	308.74517822265625
at blois dartagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal	164.62765502929688
haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water	274.66546630859375
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head	221.05621337890625
your fellowcountryman bonaparte became emperor we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican	304.7352600097656
i shall hide myself in your cabin	79.66630554199219
porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine	180.39260864257812
would not one say he was speaking of a religious community	193.2956085205078
when you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it  i believe you are right  i am glad of it  then i will go alone  go but you would do better still by not going at all  that is impossible  do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed  but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second  my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you  why  perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons  well i will have franz and châteaurenaud they will be the very men for it  do so then  but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing  that too is impossible  what a singular being you areyou will not interfere in anything  you are rightthat is the principle on which i wish to act  we will say no more about it then	116.83912658691406
it is to be tomorrow said aramis hastily	63.671470642089844
i think this is about your position is it not  confound it yes replied danglars	59.1262321472168
signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests	56.41310119628906
at least you dont speak well of him  that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim  but this letter in which he recommends you to me  is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites  but why have you not fled  whither should i go	106.58613586425781
madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance	48.19509506225586
your pardon my officer said athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good guard  your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak	77.51866149902344
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage	184.99517822265625
besides as m de tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress	109.35455322265625
alas he exclaimed how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures	159.21844482421875
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre	256.7950744628906
there is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of god to inflict death upon himself	260.6534729003906
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès	88.01620483398438
take my arm and let us go  dartagnan offered his arm to mme	82.36491394042969
he saw dartagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance	243.79049682617188
now as i am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her  you have determined then to abandon her to the common law said carlini	163.43861389160156
they must be enemies  he is right said porthos battle	202.5878143310547
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile	174.39695739746094

all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious	130.41607666015625
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity	74.37622833251953

i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow	141.9868927001953
some one  la ramee ran in haste to obey the call	161.95899963378906
here is monsieur comminges said dartagnan returning to the cardinal	46.973121643066406
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	119.6806869506836
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	182.7755126953125
dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	71.47953033447266
the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base	132.90252685546875
it was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed again	133.58152770996094
i declare i expect to look magnificent in it and chose that regiment only from vanity  mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son	197.28866577148438
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god last of all i speak to you	66.05680847167969
she became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a  console  which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syllable	107.54013061523438
speak out  are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror asked another	276.80279541015625
the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated	191.67892456054688
dartagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep	56.9879035949707
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation	113.67462921142578
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands	83.56663513183594
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos	147.04376220703125
dantès turned pale hesitated and reflected	255.1142120361328
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy tis his custom	231.98915100097656
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence	100.74453735351562
at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant	98.6520004272461
but continued m de tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as i have said i will do something for you young man	70.63935852050781
they descended to the first floor albert led his guest into the salon	76.61532592773438
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i dont know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him  oh yes but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of  what the mercers wife of the rue des fossoyeurs	94.74498748779297
see see said the young girl	43.30191421508789
as we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and  ennui  which prevented him from so doing	89.50957489013672
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great ladyfor she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass	108.77774810791016
i shall not go  why asked porthos	46.28400421142578

when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day	139.79965209960938
so much the better said dartagnan	17.900779724121094
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father  the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	68.25179290771484

yes replied caderousse little albert  but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself	143.51043701171875
bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village	300.1405334472656
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others	119.79499053955078
eleven oclock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st germain	59.114532470703125
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil	89.46298217773438
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing	49.10050964355469
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawingroom before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bowwindow and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble fathers departure	72.10637664794922
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone	42.589752197265625
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us  my dear friend you guess well	118.6500473022461
the matter was arranged as dartagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions	112.81103515625
retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind	173.69732666015625
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady	89.47266387939453
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words	94.7957763671875

but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility	216.12673950195312
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste  then cried franz it is hashish	222.2964324951172
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountaintheories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result  well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m dépinay into personal contact	162.45114135742188
we ought not therefore i think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition	158.5730743408203
you give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of  and who has filled your head with all this nonsense  why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly i learned it from beauchamps journal and thirdly from my own imagination	207.86935424804688

all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken	97.33747863769531

at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed	42.733642578125

as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance  which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists  that evening dartagnan went to present his respects to m dessessart and inform him of his promotion	137.61146545410156
my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife  this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious	129.9247283935547
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury	184.46922302246094
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil	114.31676483154297
about what time  why about fifteen or eighteen days ago  exactly so  and yesterday evening he came again  yesterday evening  yes just before you came  my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies	233.75704956054688
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me  your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered	98.90474700927734
they wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them	92.59909057617188
go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage	93.70173645019531
speak dartagnan speak  dartagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him	69.4067153930664
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth	232.1173858642578
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to this	93.21559143066406
clear sky swiftflitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château dif seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy	97.25457763671875
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured	153.8456268310547
a puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands	253.5502471923828
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to heaven	110.92906951904297
yes of course mouston nothing else	151.846923828125
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair  incognita  belonged to the aristocracy	158.3302459716797
swear to be mute  i never swear my lord i say yes or no and as i am a gentleman i keep my word  come then i see that i must trust unreservedly to you  believe me my lord it will be your best plan  come said mazarin conducting dartagnan into the queens oratory and desiring him to wait there	112.91658020019531
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted  well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain  thats useless said dartagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party  at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held	103.93998718261719
what dreadful sufferings said julie remembering valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her brother	247.9414520263672
let us then take advantage of it then aloud  well my dear la ramee	87.79953002929688
some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more	625.1785888671875
it is true the cardinal had been particularly illtempered	46.6422004699707
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade	40.966365814208984
valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of everyday life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body	168.29615783691406
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance  ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreignersscotch irish or danish	206.0443878173828
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded  yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang youat which i should be most unhappy certainly  and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny	141.7433624267578
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us  it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore  where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council  yes said aramis athos is right  animadvertuntur in desertis   a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it  there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	113.44979858398438
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twentyfive years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist	108.08243560791016
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave  how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster	147.4763946533203

he wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his mouth	125.06631469726562
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else	59.12741470336914
a good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass	197.53057861328125
and the troop continued their route	129.90774536132812
who informed you this was the master i propose to you	98.65383911132812
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of age	216.98619079589844
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction	99.02993774414062
his recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnestly	537.1356201171875
but what is the meaning of all these questions  to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services  oh said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid  sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes  how is that  i have the payment under my hand i almost possess it  what is it	115.74291229248047

de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him	92.50614166259766
i can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and monsieur de cambon the substitute for monsieur dartagnan still holds his place  the two friends looked at each other	120.26173400878906
i came to pray over the body of your daughter  and now why are you here  i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do  good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni  no the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face	109.56672668457031
yes said aramis impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself  be satisfied replied dartagnan the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell  he then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller	85.43426513671875
27 rue du helder  have you bachelors apartments there	390.0787658691406
the abbess introduced them to each other	111.43328857421875
there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and m de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten	171.3011474609375
at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend	47.13701629638672
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth  my fifty recruits from the chevalier dhumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks  and where are you going  to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble  very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him	123.66236877441406
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	298.66290283203125
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean	123.736328125
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercédès	87.38683319091797
a terrible inclination seized dartagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained himself	104.99138641357422
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one	86.25782775878906
i am cold i am hungry	44.914615631103516
it is on her account i am here i wish to see valentine  30315m    villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her stepmother and that she should be fetched	65.06690216064453
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud to wait on us	150.13531494140625
it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed i am approved by a man like you fresh from the court  but you speak of him not of his party his resources  it is truethe queen is for him  something in his favor  but he will never have the king  a mere child  a child who will be of age in four years	121.58167266845703
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair	275.1558837890625
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming table	129.6573028564453
did you pass through the corso  yes  well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross	119.77003479003906
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up	87.8349609375
ah dont be angry i beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me	118.27627563476562
your excellency has not stated the number of guests  ah true  how many covers  count for yourself  is everyone here your excellency  yes  bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar	225.05345153808594
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you  dartagnan became more and more astonished	179.79165649414062
tomorrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy  but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men  monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are won  then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight	203.96937561035156
speak speak in heavens name and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair	184.81593322753906
she told dartagnan that lord de winter was her brotherinlaw and not her brother	53.62664794921875
you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly  how so said andrea	140.63687133789062
a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing	95.53868103027344
at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account  penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them	146.83966064453125
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person  yes but in our situation we must not say all we knowparticularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues  well can i see porthos  certainly monsieur	120.41270446777344
why you must have lost your senses  whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel  listen to me franz said albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us	115.41388702392578
is the committee willing to hear this witnessyes yes they all said at once	130.29623413085938
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress  ah said hegood good	147.56671142578125
milady looked at this man and hesitated	85.86800384521484
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal	67.15389251708984
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous	79.39398193359375
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair	34.527305603027344
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him	96.23168182373047
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation	129.00527954101562
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away  who told you that my dear asked milady	112.82282257080078
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take	108.6805419921875
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered	159.17608642578125
20311m    he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocketbook and both began for the third time to count their gold and banknotes	109.48770904541016
reflect upon it  dartagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that dartagnan carried into everything	270.6203918457031
he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and castoff cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master	197.906005859375
all was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had said	143.15899658203125
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one  perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and thats rather against him  well well returned m morrel we shall see	106.68457794189453
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect	116.10436248779297
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please  then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated  franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinxlike smile	100.19359588623047
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort	225.10992431640625
we must have felt what it is to die morrel that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living	88.50819396972656
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others  pray do so  there was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling	114.13200378417969
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo   pardieu  everyone exists  doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses  have you seen the greek mistress  i have both seen and heard her	199.77783203125
by the way  what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated	161.73765563964844
i will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to leghorn	155.94313049316406
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard	216.1482696533203
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if mme	129.6971893310547
besides dartagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her	290.65106201171875
i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us 50000 francs for it	62.079010009765625
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips	79.07061767578125
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback	115.73104095458984
do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if i want money i can send for some to any of my chateaux at bracieux alone i have twenty thousand francs in gold	69.39353942871094
my lord said dartagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de la fere  willingly said the cardinal i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake  i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos	56.960575103759766
you must have much reason to complain of him  not very much said dartagnan	62.903839111328125
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss	151.90565490722656
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when dartagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing  dartagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness	113.08566284179688
well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it  go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love and that i love you morrel  40260m    i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid	103.25663757324219
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room	98.11592864990234
the house of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome the duchess one of the last heiresses of the colonnas does its honors with the most consummate grace and thus their  fêtes  have a european celebrity	110.09756469726562
the marriage feast  the mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of rubytinted light	257.906494140625
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step	517.3110961914062
in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450000 francs	99.3416748046875
it remains  here  said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly	54.317832946777344
come let us see what you will do for me  everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply	69.3278579711914
quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem   aramis cast a glance upon dartagnan to see what effect all this produced and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws	179.8046875
they who love believe easily in love	300.272216796875
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds a boars ham with jelly a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster	124.26261901855469
at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the musketeers hastening to the hôtel of m de tréville the guards to that of m dessessart	56.60978698730469
very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman  but the kingwhere is the king exclaimed athos anxiously	59.735286712646484
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur dartagnan theres not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him  then my lord replied dartagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much youunderstand me  be it so	99.45783996582031
besides repentance becomes the guilty whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of god  guilty	343.54833984375
what is he doing up there and they called châteaurenauds attention to him	104.70140838623047

employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads  my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails you	115.10517883300781
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st peters  franz silently assented and the following afternoon at halfpast five oclock the young men parted	165.04039001464844
well now you understand mother continued albert here are more than 4000 francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two years  do you think so said mercédès	131.90902709960938

die cried mademoiselle paulet bitterly he	579.9415893554688

he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned	96.48332977294922
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain	195.9585418701172

i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof	90.64971160888672
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king	113.58642578125

there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous tone	228.99978637695312
we have already observed with what rapidity dartagnan seized the expression of a countenance	62.759971618652344
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor	322.11358642578125
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive	389.6186828613281

the next morning dartagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer	166.17062377929688
do you not know these bits of paper  banknotes  exactly there are fifteen of them  and whose are they  yours if you like  mine exclaimed the man halfsuffocated	161.03689575195312

why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother	55.77050018310547
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	84.11971282958984
father cried maximilian how could you say the  pharaon  was lost	134.79527282714844
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive  lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sisterinlaw employed them they must be the best	134.79083251953125

is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words	166.5471954345703
goodnight and before dantès could open his mouthbefore he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the waterbefore he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoners mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon	160.0643310546875
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower	53.33305358886719
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them	274.0682373046875
but as to what had been done by porthos and dartagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau	64.37315368652344
was that it  if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said dartagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavyfor with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like  these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery  at all events answered dartagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their swords  he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money	142.0362548828125
love   pardon for what asked she	178.6267547607422
gentlemen said athos a wager  ah  wooi  a vager cried the swiss	74.53595733642578

this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow	87.79785919189453
to break my vow in behalf of the exemperor this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments	122.72142791748047
he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate	73.19562530517578
two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor	143.25022888183594
oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer	148.2910614013672
silence  but you promised me whispered the poor mercer	117.60315704345703
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champsélysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light	59.042274475097656
petition the minister  oh i know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three  that is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me  and will you undertake to deliver it  with the greatest pleasure	114.26705932617188

come gentlemen let us all propose some place	147.6807403564453
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to alberts request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon	151.444580078125
then he pointed to the door	27.564903259277344

i have my sword  and no one waiting for you outside  no  then you had better come with me  thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose  cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it	116.86359405517578
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money	134.08766174316406
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart  bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced	112.15850067138672
alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me  he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly	60.31968688964844

a single portrait signed by léopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame	199.01217651367188
that is a serious thing  monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said	111.7444076538086
the queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like diana of poictiers and ninon anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression	233.9559783935547
well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy	65.9950942993164
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter  oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied madame danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you	136.27752685546875
thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse	41.45537185668945
that day the ministers clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his illhumor	57.58549880981445
on seeing the appointed signal groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen	122.96124267578125

that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres  it appears so said athos since here they are	107.75001525878906
felton approached her and said lord de winter who is a catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your mass and here is a book which contains the ritual  at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words  your mass  at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer	124.55733489990234
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait  yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners  bah said athos	197.93893432617188
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foots pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles	112.0704574584961
oh i am dying he again fainted	87.00397491455078
i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or delay	377.2744445800781
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun	162.78814697265625
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all  oh cried the executioner all	46.71052551269531
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more  significant  if the expression may be used	199.58016967773438
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin dor	144.93673706054688
dartagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly	117.16773986816406
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel down with mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten	412.92730712890625
these 900000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience  having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased	128.78831481933594
he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in the day there and rarely slept there	207.9759521484375
what then would be the use of all i have suffered	48.09927749633789
in an hour inquired danglars turning pale	105.61909484863281
oh my friends said dartagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these gentlemen	75.6332015991211
héloïse héloïse he said what is the matter	117.40542602539062
but one word more count  what is it  advice  be careful advice is worse than a service  oh you can give me this without compromising yourself  tell me what it is  is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres  that is the sum m danglars himself announced  must i receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary  this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance  because said andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness i thought i heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now  well replied monte cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve months	180.16522216796875
can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which i have just received said the astonished athos	82.65385437011719
why are not my frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead  well said the president seeing that charles was determined to remain silent so be it	150.10189819335938
except that which i ask of you dear love  but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness  i cannot wait till tomorrow  silence	103.17877960205078
has he not already forgotten she ever existed	284.28607177734375
there is the port he murmured	99.17440795898438
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria	71.11504364013672
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly	110.33821868896484
i am anxious to know the state of your health  he calls that a language	54.28466033935547
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said	131.62428283691406
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip	152.90614318847656
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself	186.56199645996094
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her	106.6201400756836
or dreamed he was and awoke mad  after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here  so the matter ended for the abbé faria	146.01263427734375
since the death of little edward a great change had taken place in monte cristo	121.9006576538086
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	91.60235595703125
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the onehalf per cent it had originally paid	256.80426025390625
and you did not tell him that you came from me  no sir  at ten oclock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter	73.7304916381836
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age	118.01880645751953
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion	169.68585205078125
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon	148.4424591064453
thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disobeyed baptistin bowed	218.23541259765625
you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this  dartagnan is right said athos here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i dont know where	124.61312103271484
come gentlemen cried harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off  where do we sleep colonel  at thirsk replied harrison	309.9732360839844
only leave him in the anteroom as i wish to speak to you alone  dartagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour both commands alike both at the palais royal	120.74370574951172
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard	99.93903350830078
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month	172.36614990234375
and any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal but my love came out from it more ardent and more eternal	252.40199279785156
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	75.11338806152344
dartagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of porthos which amused him greatly	120.8869857788086
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan  these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated	173.8201141357422
they have abducted her added the commissary and do you know the man who has committed this deed  i think i know him  who is he  remember that i affirm nothing monsieur the commissary and that i only suspect  whom do you suspect	94.72294616699219
i used to play almost every night in france  and since your return to england  i have not handled a card or dicebox  i sincerely pity you said dartagnan with an air of profound compassion	100.42658233642578
happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to ones self and the wallswalls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness danglars is happy  and fernand  fernand	332.89764404296875
for me said dartagnan are you sure of that   pardieu  monsieur i cant be more sure	60.572288513183594
ah cried blaisois he is lost  grimauds a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton	61.1124267578125
oh for pitys sake  you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel one of my friends had not stopped him  listen to me my son has also guessed who you arehe attributes his fathers misfortunes to you  madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunesit is a punishment	106.20943450927734
so if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum	69.14584350585938
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally but i know a great number of her most intimate friends	83.05489349365234
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too	95.7031478881836
what have i said  you said that porthos had received a sword cut  yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so  and why so  zounds monsieur	117.39781188964844
it was therefore near seven oclock but edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head	186.78016662597656
i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer ill stave your wicked head in with this oar  dartagnan	180.25193786621094
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear	152.12673950195312
you are the king of lackeys	60.789878845214844
