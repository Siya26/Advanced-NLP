the joy of the king was lively	59.58695602416992
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him	71.01179504394531
franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arminarm with the peasant girl	371.94677734375
the chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand heaven be praised and his holiness also said he in a loud voice here is a pardon for one of the prisoners  a pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon  at this cry andrea raised his head	206.18325805664062
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see  i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians  anne was caught she could not draw backshe signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep	179.77528381347656
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m bonacieux	107.47492218017578
how sprightly you are said caderousse one would say you were already in possession of your property  no unfortunately but when i do obtain it  well  i shall remember old friends i can tell you that  yes since you have such a good memory  what do you want	105.6294174194336
in the commandments of god or of the church i dont know which	71.84265899658203
the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dantès paused with anguish on his brow	251.43907165527344
for me said dartagnan seizing the letter	36.33916091918945
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes	240.3975830078125
the valet de chambre announced m de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china	147.6502685546875
is it you mordaunt said cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may remain  i come to congratulate you  to congratulate mewhat for  on the capture of charles stuart	129.88316345214844
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity	213.1137237548828
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering  i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources  however  my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence  the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m de villefort	109.5394515991211
do you again defy me  no the fact is i have found my father  what	115.25132751464844
his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnuttrees	163.2582244873047
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home  yes yes	64.89790344238281
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed thats all	70.17768859863281
these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries	214.87513732910156
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart  ennui  can find no place  you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace	710.3983764648438
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end	115.83014678955078
we will do the same  the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with dartagnan	74.17269134521484
what did your father tell you m morrel said he eagerly	59.87507629394531
the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air	44.60638427734375
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said	125.9025650024414
parry who accompanied him stood behind him	210.66140747070312
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m davrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime	211.8055419921875
the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said  gentlemen we are about to sign the contract  the baron was to sign first then the representative of m cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents	387.5326843261719
he shall see how a gentleman can die  the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically	305.4910583496094
dartagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last	137.65325927734375
well said he on perceiving dartagnan	111.03956604003906
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure	105.39878845214844
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right dartagnan mouston will do mouston has a very fine appearance  dartagnan smiled	142.64105224609375
but in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry	245.7822723388672
as for me i will give my last sou for it	94.50233459472656
for what purpose  upon my honor i will instantly return it to you	123.66260528564453
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels	67.02474975585938
m bonacieux was at his door	28.74774742126465
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her	201.27674865722656
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his sidenot from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times	242.99017333984375
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal  yes and the queen too  the queen do you say  to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i dont know how she has regained possession  but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you  so i think replied dartagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them  yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and youto whom are you devoted now  to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devotion also  and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf  magnificent my dear fellow magnificent	148.45152282714844
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired	173.36947631835938
i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count  monte cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark	119.66927337646484
occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in darkness	217.97415161132812
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandits dinner through the crevices of the doormay i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goatskin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy	186.4927215576172
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously said	150.83998107910156
for gods sake tell me did you know this englishman  but you tell me also that the house of thomson  french have constantly denied having rendered you this service  yes  then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation  everything is possible in this affair even a miracle  what was his name asked monte cristo	183.25119018554688
he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven oclock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the hôtel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood	100.84257507324219
it is not aramis cried he	51.361263275146484
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray	112.70060729980469
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	164.17855834960938
bonacieux dead and to dartagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life	111.2706527709961
the prince assigned the count de guiche to his father and kept bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them	107.00396728515625
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself	195.47418212890625
in the corridor he met mme	57.02726745605469
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold wellwater  the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage	219.284912109375
he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys command	175.41033935546875
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spini feel very keenly fernand that this is charity  and if it were mercédès poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles	185.29721069335938
the prisoner is there replied vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free  the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as alberts prison and franz and the count followed him	104.75338745117188
ha ha said châteaurenaud here come some friends of yours viscount	282.6078186035156
you had friends albert break off their acquaintance	460.9481201171875
meanwhile villefort and davrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold	311.5221252441406
tomorrow you shall be free  i had but one wish that was that he should kill me	85.71382141113281
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday	271.4130859375
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake  noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	218.52386474609375
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them	135.59982299804688
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat	197.7605438232422
i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible  but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell  that is to say i am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms	136.35162353515625
is supper ready signor pastrini  yes your excellency  well then let us sup  but the carriage and horses said franz	211.3192901611328
the child went directly to him without kissing his mother	161.1186981201172
the minutes passed madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine	96.78459167480469
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future	227.48980712890625
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her	122.73646545410156
at the extremity of the wood dartagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle	58.204959869384766
art thou dangerously wounded my dear mousqueton he said	712.3868408203125
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect  a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis	148.83731079101562
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses	130.95761108398438
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue	346.2923583984375
in all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning	222.690673828125
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief	237.1363067626953
i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived	48.905235290527344
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the chestnow madame here are 800 notes of 1000 francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25000 francs then for the odd cash making i think about 110000 francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured  madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of banknotes	425.4402160644531
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel	204.28492736816406
30043m    a quarter of an hour was the reply	41.57242965698242
immediately m de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms	83.31871795654297
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil	79.65065002441406
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon  porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something	137.0653533935547
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down	422.3414306640625
you lie said the abbé busoni with a tone of irresistible authority	113.1143569946289
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	294.66571044921875
there is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfathers room she rose	177.3487548828125
we can talk of it afterward  then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed	117.2449722290039
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you	150.70944213867188
a poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which i have sought so long rests on me for a moment	210.73696899414062
if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand  so you know beforehand you must perish said dartagnan	94.9298095703125
let us see said the queen what the count says and she opened the letter and read  madamebeing unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory cannot fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe	105.90973663330078
the two things agree marvelously well  i am all attention said dartagnan	170.06031799316406
the evening was no longer joy but delirium	160.43211364746094
i inquired immediately on my return to paris the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine years	113.27277374267578
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byrons heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society  you say  i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag	269.5253601074219
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me i am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife	96.09659576416016
but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another steplong live the emperor said the figure	222.49685668945312
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it  the young man then entered the apartment of aramis	112.90962982177734
be clear short and precise  as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which i formed onewent yesterday to saint germain to impose on you	175.29295349121094
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefortobserve that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefortvillefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the soninlaw of the marquis and marquise de saintméran	123.25070190429688
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet	112.45281219482422
40054m    indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does	124.61324310302734
one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance	134.52391052246094
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect confidence in him	66.85548400878906
we will not go till evening  this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it	292.70458984375
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne  and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon  perhaps returned the count smiling	123.8377914428711
porthos could hardly keep his countenance	210.72158813476562
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures	466.3687438964844
one by one the several groups broke up	748.8790283203125
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply	119.70169067382812
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i dont know who for my part  and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne inquired athos in a tremulous voice	40.928741455078125
there was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like shame	348.73834228515625
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carousal	434.6549987792969
one of us would suffice  really my dear monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me  i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence  and bernouindo i not take him with me  there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence  let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish  my lord there is time to draw back said dartagnan and your eminence is perfectly free  not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off  and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of dartagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling	119.08716583251953
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii	307.49737548828125
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m de villefort     chapter 52	51.69858932495117
the curate then entered followed by planchet	147.22625732421875
yes doctor  is this the same lemonade of which you partook  i believe so  what did it taste like  it had a bitter taste  the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lips to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace	233.2794647216797
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death  be easy said dartagnan he will know all before night  the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead	164.92372131347656
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty	347.55419921875
no said the notary then perhaps it is to your son m de villefort  no the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator	103.58048248291016
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them	191.95103454589844
let me conduct your business and my own	98.56157684326172
i do not reject it altogether said athos but i wish to remind aramis that he cannot quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours after the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested  without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of us  gentlemen said dartagnan what porthos says is full of sense  ah ah	178.3848419189453
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow dartagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself	138.97926330566406
the southern districts were illwatched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or uzès	897.5499877929688
ifaith no said dartagnan i was not in voice monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either	112.38805389404297
the next day came and passed the day after a week i then wrote to the cardinal	58.34870910644531
why you see he did not expect to see dantès return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless	294.42205810546875
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted	147.26002502441406
rise and answer  peppino glanced anxiously at franz	819.8885498046875
the first prince of the blood the kings uncle  no	200.89483642578125
the story   volume two chapter 28	456.8287353515625
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title  why said the banker	85.08000946044922
after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate	151.27101135253906
privately  yes  well i will remain with you at this moment villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came madame de villefort	99.27527618408203
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me  and what shall i say to the people  that they must have patience said anne as i have  the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went out	113.31954956054688
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse	681.0256958007812
meantime dartagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	148.33016967773438
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report	134.0547332763672
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding	186.52854919433594
